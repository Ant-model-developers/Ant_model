Strategic align-ment is not necessarily a unidirectional undertaking in the sense that a BPM strategy must be oriented toward the corporate strategy; successful BPM can also shape corporate strategy when innovative process designs or improved process performance provide an opportunity for BPM to be a competitive differentiator. In addition, BPM has proven to be a powerful means by which to innovate business models in a great number of cases, such as through the creative appropriation of IT. While  the  signiﬁcance  of  strategic  alignment  is  widely  acknowledged,  its operationalization often remains a challenge in BPM initiatives, and it remains a largely open question in the BPM community. Since there is often a gap between the overall strategy and the more operational issues of process operations, how we can demonstrate the strategic relevance of process-related initiatives or ensure
strategy-supportive process design is a central issue.
In the opening chapter of this section Jerry Luftman introduces the ﬁeld of strategic alignment by presenting the concept of strategic alignment maturity. Based on a thorough understanding of the role of process in strategic alignment, Luftman distinguishes ﬁve levels of strategic alignment maturity and six alignment maturity criteria and discusses measures by which to overcome gaps in alignment. Subsequently, Luftman presents an approach to measuring the strategic alignment maturity of an organization and reports on the results from 362 global companies across four continents that have gone through the assessment. After deriving a six-step-process on how to increase strategic alignment maturity, Luftman closes the chapter with a report on research that validates the contribution of strategic align-ment maturity (SAM) to company performance based on the data gathered from the 362 organizations.
In the second chapter in this section, Roger Burlton focuses on the challenges of strategic alignment in BPM, referring to the problem of being “Lost in Translation.” Burlton begins by unfolding the nature of this problem and provides speciﬁc methodological support for strategically aligning BPM. The approach also provides a framework for the subsequent chapters, which examine the various strategic
2	Part I   Strategic Alignment

options BPM offers. The study from Mathias Kirchmer focuses on innovation and agility as cornerstones of many corporate strategies and discusses the role of process automation as a means by which to leverage these objectives.
Key to strategic alignment is the value assessment of Business Process Man-agement initiatives. Jan vom Brocke and Christian Sonnenberg report on this stream of research that has emerged over the past years. After a thorough discussion of the concept of value, the authors present several methods as examples of how to assess the strategic value contribution of process-related work, including the return-on-process transformation as an effective performance measure. Along these lines, Markus Brenner, Andre Coners, and Benjamin Matthies introduce the concept of process capital management and illustrate the approach by means of a real-life example from Lufthansa.
´
In order to implement the strategic objectives, the “right” processes have to be dealt with in the “right” way. Frameworks are needed for this purpose to facilitate the selection of process and action. In the sixth chapter Constantin Houy, Peter Fettke, and Peter Loos introduce business process frameworks. The article analyzes and systemizes the various facets of process frameworks, describes and explains the classes of business process frameworks, and presents a number of exemplary process frameworks. Then business process reference models (as one prominent class of process frameworks) are presented in more detail. The seventh chapter by Chris Aitken, Christine Stephenson, and Ryan Brinkworth discusses how organi-zations can build on business frameworks in order to classify company-speciﬁc processes. Their results are summarized in a comprehensive framework that may serve as a starting point for developing an individual corporate process schema. Case studies from the health sector and the investment management industry, in which the framework is used to align descriptions of organizational behavior to produce useful integrated behavioral reference models and uniﬁed process model sets, are described. Their contribution shows that process frameworks must be individualized for an organization’s speciﬁc context (e.g., products, customers, competition). Drawing from empirical studies, Tobias Bucher, David Raber, and Robert Winter present a taxonomy of BPM approaches to support choosing the right BPM approach for the speciﬁc contextual situation of an organization. The chapter concludes with a practical application of the approach.
The performance assessment of processes plays an important role in managing existing processes. Drawing from management accounting and performance mea-surement in particular, Diana Heckl, Michael Leyer, and Jurgen Moormann provide an overview of contemporary approaches to process performance measurement and apply  process  mining,  as  an  example,  to  real  case  data  to  demonstrate  the approaches.  Given  the  attention  big (process) data  and  related  analytics  have recently attracted, Michael zur Muehlen, and Robert Shapiro’s chapter introduces business process analytics. The authors show how data generated by PAIS can be used for the cost-effective, real-time assessment of processes.

Abstract  Strategic Alignment is one of the six core elements of BPM. In this chapter, an introduction to Strategic Alignment is given. Against the background of foundations on IT-Business Alignment, several important insights are provided for the strategic alignment in BPM. A maturity model is presented in order to assess different levels of capabilities based on key criteria to evaluate alignment maturity. Also, results from a global empirical study are presented and discussed in the light of BPM.


1   Introduction

The  global  importance  of  alignment  has  remained  on  the  top  of  information technology surveys for almost three decades. Alignment addresses both how IT is aligned with the business and how business should or could be aligned with IT. Consequently, strategic alignment is also one of the six core elements of BPM (Rosemann and vom Brocke 2014). Terms such as harmony, link, fuse, ﬁt, match, meld, converge, interwoven, and integrate are frequently used synonymously with the term alignment (perhaps a reason why alignment has been so evasive). What-ever term you prefer, it is a persistent/pervasive problem that demands an ongoing process to ensure that IT and business strategies adapt effectively and efﬁciently together. Perhaps most important is recognizing that there is signiﬁcant research available that demonstrates  the relationship of alignment  to ﬁrm  performance (Luftman 2007; Luftman et al. 2011). More speciﬁcally, successful alignment ensures that organizations can create value out of their IT assets by furnishing these assets in a way that supports business processes according to business strategy (vom Brocke et al. 2014). Figure 1 illustrates this relationship and also indicates the

relationship  between  business  process  management  (BPM)  and  IT  business alignment.
Mature IT business alignment requires a mature “IT use process”, i.e. business processes with well-deﬁned requirements regarding IT support. Therefore, business process management translates between the business side and the IT side via the deﬁnition, execution, and control of “IT use processes” (vom Brocke et al. 2012). Mature IT business alignment also contributes to successful BPM (Luftman 2007) since it facilitates the management of “IT use processes” and thus increases the potential to translate IT investments into business value. In this regard, IT business alignment  can  be  understood  as  being  essentially  a  BPM  task  that  primarily addresses both the strategy and the technology dimension of BPM (see the chapter on the six core elements of BPM in this handbook by (Rosemann and vom Brocke 2014) without neglecting governance, methods, people, and culture dimensions (see discussion below). Given the signiﬁcance of IT business alignment maturity for BPM the question is how alignment maturity can be measured and how it emerges?
This chapter presents a Strategic Alignment Maturity (SAM) assessment tool that was developed from the author’s work since 2000 (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Kempaiah 2007b; Luftman 1997, 2000). SAM, which has been applied globally by organizations of all sizes, evaluates six components (and 41 factors) of an organi-zation  to  identify  an  alignment  maturity  score  and  more  importantly  speciﬁc opportunities to improve the IT business relationship will be elaborated on in this chapter. As an introduction, the six components (Communications, Value Metrics, Governance, Partnership, Technology Scope, and Human Resources) for assessing alignment maturity along with the 41 speciﬁc criteria/factors measured for each component are illustrated in Fig. 4(X axis). Also illustrated in Fig. 4are the average overall scores and the differences in the scores as assessed by business and IT leaders. The scores an organization achieves for each of the 41 factors included in the six components of maturity are based on a ﬁve-level maturity model. The model denotes the organization’s IT-business alignment maturity, with Level 1 indicating the lowest maturity and Level 5 indicating exemplar maturity.
Strategic Alignment Maturity	7

Business-IT alignment refers to applying Information Technology (IT) in an appropriate and timely way, in harmony with business strategies, goals, and needs. It has been a fundamental concern of business and IT executives since the 1970s. This deﬁnition of alignment addresses:

1. How IT is aligned with the business
2. How the business should or could be aligned with IT.

It does not matter whether one considers alignment from either a business-driven perspective (IT enabled) or from an IT-driven perspective; the objective is to ensure that the organizational strategies adapt harmoniously. The evidence that IT has the power to transform whole industries and markets is strong (Luftman 2007; Luftman et al. 2011; Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Luftman and Derksen 2012). Important questions that need to be addressed include the following:

•   How can organizations assess alignment?
•   How can organizations improve alignment?
•   How can organizations achieve mature alignment?

The purpose of this chapter is to present an approach for assessing the maturity of a ﬁrm’s business-IT alignment and its importance to business process manage-ment (BPM). Until recently, nothing has been available. The alignment maturity assessment described in this chapter provides a comprehensive descriptive and prescriptive vehicle for organizations to evaluate business-IT alignment in terms of where they are and what they can do to improve the alignment. The maturity assessment  applies  the  previous  research  that  identiﬁed  enablers/inhibitors  to achieving alignment (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Derksen 2012; Luftman and Brier 1999), and the empirical evidence gathered by management consultants who applied the methodology that leverages the most important enablers and inhibitors as building blocks for the evaluation.


2   Why Alignment Is Important

Alignment’s importance has been well known and well documented since the late 1970s. (Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Luftman and Derksen 2012; Luftman and Brier 1999; Keen 1996; Henderson and Venkatraman 1996) Over the years, it has persisted among the top-ranked concerns of business executives. IT and business alignment was the second highest-ranked issue in the 2012 trends survey of IT leaders from 362 global organizations (Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Luftmanand Zadeh 2011).
With the enduring economic uncertainties prevailing, organizations are focusing on leveraging IT to swiftly reduce business expenses by leveraging IT for BPM initiatives and, new to 2012, increase revenues. IT appears to be quite resilient, with IT  budgets,  hiring,  and  salary  increases  on  the  rise,  and  slowly  approaching pre-recession levels.
BPMisconsideredoneofthemostimportantsolutionsforleveragingIT’sability to reduce business expenses, including working with business partners, to improve,
8	J. Luftman

or to re-engineer processes (vom Brocke 2011). Technology alone is not sufﬁcient; strong collaboration with the business to change how they leverage technology is required. This collaboration is mediated through business process management using business processes (or the “IT use process”) as a sense making device.
Alignment seems more important as companies strive to integrate technology and business in light of dynamic business strategies and the continuously evolving technologies. In addition to the importance of alignment, what has not been clear is how to achieve and sustain this harmony between business and IT, how to assess the maturity of alignment, and what the impact of misalignment might be on the ﬁrm. To achieve and sustain this synergistic relationship is anything but easy.
There are several reasons why attaining IT-business alignment has been so elusive.
The ﬁrst reason is that the deﬁnition of alignment is frequently focused only on how IT is aligned (e.g., converged, in harmony, integrated, linked, synchronized) with the business. Alignment must also address how the business is aligned with IT. Alignment must focus on how IT and the business are aligned with each other; IT can both enable and drive business change.
The second reason is that organizations (practitioners, consultants, academics) have often looked for a silver bullet. Originally, some thought the right technology (e.g.,  infrastructure,  applications)  was  the  answer.  While  important,  it  is  not enough. Likewise, improved communications between IT and the business help, but are not enough. Similarly, establishing a partnership is not enough nor is balanced metrics that combine appropriate business and technical measurements. Clearly, mature alignment cannot be attained without effective and efﬁcient exe-cution and demonstration of value, but this alone is insufﬁcient. More recently, governance has been touted as the answer – to identify and prioritize projects, resources,  and  risks.  Today,  we  also  recognize  the  importance  of  having  the appropriate skills to execute and support the environment. Our research has found that all six of these components must be addressed to improve alignment.
The third reason IT-business alignment has been elusive is that there has not been an effective tool to gauge the maturity of IT-business alignment – a tool that can provide both a descriptive assessment and a prescriptive roadmap on how to improve. As you will see the insights from the alignment maturity benchmarking provides extensive insights to this longstanding conundrum.
The fourth reason that IT-business alignment has been so difﬁcult to achieve is that there is a tendency in many organizations (even ones where the importance of alignment is recognized) to focus their attention on IT infrastructure considerations. This  unbalanced  approach  can  often  lead  to  missed  opportunities  to  identify elements of the business infrastructure that are in need of improvements.
Finally, the ﬁfth reason that the advancement of IT-business alignment has been stalled involves semantic differences in how to refer to it. Disagreements regarding alignment terminology (“linked” vs. “converged”; “integrated” vs. “harmonized”) have ironically become a barrier to alignment itself.
While there is no silver bullet for achieving alignment, progress has been made. In fact, the research demonstrates that “a line” has been drawn. When organizations cross it, they have identiﬁed and addressed ways to enhance IT-business alignment.
Strategic Alignment Maturity	9

The alignment maturity model is thus both descriptive and prescriptive. CIO’s can use it to identify their organization’s alignment maturity and identify means to enhance it. Yet, that “line” is dynamic and continually evolving. So alignment can always be improved.
From measuring the six components in organizations in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and India, it can be observed that most organizations today are in Level 3of a ﬁve-level maturity assessmentmodel. Hence, the pronouncement of the “death of alignment” is premature; there is still a long way to go in the journey for aligning IT and business.
Identifying an organization’s alignment maturity provides an excellent vehicle for understanding and improving the business-IT alignment. As elaborated on in this chapter, alignment maturity focuses on six important areas. ALL must be simultaneously addressed to improve the harmony among IT and business. Too frequently consultants and practitioners, looking for the silver bullet, focused their attention on only one or a subset of these important considerations. As companies strive to link technology and business they must address both

•   Doing the right things (effectiveness), and
•   Doing things right (efﬁciency). (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Luftman and Brier 1999)
In recent years, a great deal of research and analysis focused on the linkages among Business and IT (Luftman 2007; Luftman et al. 2011; Luftman 2012; Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Luftman and Brier 1999), the role of partnerships among IT and business management (Keen 1996), and the need to understand the transformation of business strategies resulting from the competitive use of IT (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Derksen 2012; Davidson 1996). Firms need to change not only their business scope, but also their infrastructure as a result of IT innova-tion (Luftman 2007; Weill and Broadbent 1998). Much of this research, however, was conceptual. Empirical studies of alignment (Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Henderson and Venkatraman 1996; Baets 1996) only examined a single industry and/or ﬁrm. Conclusions from such empirical studies are potentially biased and may not be applicable to other industries. These studies lacked the consistent results across industries, across functional positions, and across time. This provided the impetus for deﬁning a vehicle for assessing business-IT alignment, along with providing a roadmap for how best to improve it: IT alignment maturity.
As previously discussed, alignment maturity evolves into a relationship in which the function of IT and other business functions adapt their strategies together. Achieving alignment  is evolutionary and dynamic. IT requires strong support from senior management, good working relationships, strong leadership, appropri-ate prioritization, trust, and effective communication, as well as a thorough under-standing of the business and technical environments. Achieving and sustaining alignment  demands focusing  on  maximizing  the  enablers  and  minimizing  the inhibitors that cultivate the integration of IT and business.
Alignment of IT strategy and the organization’s business strategy is a fundamen-tal principle advocated for several decades (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Kempaiah 2007a; Rogers 1997; Rockart et al. 1996). IT investment has been increasing since

itsinception, asmanagers lookforways tomanage ITsuccessfullyandtointegrateit into the organization’s strategies. As a result, IT managers need to:
•   Be knowledgeable about how the new IT technologies can be integrated into the business, and with existing/emerging technologies
•   Be privy to senior management’s tactical and strategic plans •   Be present when corporate strategies are discussed
•   Understand the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies in question and the corporate-wide implications (Rockart et al. 1996)

Several proposed frameworks assess the strategic issues of IT as a competitive weapon.  They  have  not,  however,  yielded  empirical  evidence;  nor  have  they provided a roadmap to assess and enhance alignment. Numerous studies focus on business  process  redesign and reengineering as a way to achieve competitive advantage with IT. This advantage comes from the appropriate application of IT as a driver and enabler of business strategies.


3   Strategic Alignment Maturity

The concept of alignment maturity as a necessary precondition for an organiza-tion’s ability to implement its strategy emerged as a concept in the late 1990s as it became  increasingly  evident  that  organizations  were,  by  and  large,  failing  to successfully execute nominally well-deﬁned strategic objectives. Why was this the case? Early research into this issue (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Kempaiah 2007b) hypothesized that an organization’s ability to successfully implement strat-egy was related to the “level” of strategic alignment between IT and the business, which reﬂects both the dynamic nature of alignment and the fact that alignment is, itself, a process that reﬂects key organizational practices which enable (or inhibit, in their absence or misapplication) alignment (Luftman and Brier 1999; Luftman 2000). A model of alignment maturity emerged from this research that reﬂects these concepts. As Fig. 1 illustrates, the Strategic Alignment Maturity model involves the following ﬁve conceptual levels of strategic alignment maturity:

1. Initial/Ad Hoc Process – business and IT are not aligned or harmonized
2. Committed Process – the organization has committed to becoming aligned
3. Established Focused Process – Strategic Alignment Maturity established and focused on business objectives
4. Improved/Managed Process – Reinforcing the concept of IT as a “Value Center” 5. Optimized  Process  –  Integrated  and  co-adaptive  business  and  IT  strategic
planning

Each of the ﬁve levels of alignment maturity focuses, in turn, on a set of six components based on practices validated in 2001 with an evaluation of 25 “Fortune 500” companies. As of the writing of this Chapter 362 Global 1,000 organizations from around the world (and several hundred smaller companies) and 2,100 business and IT executives have participated in formally assessing their IT business align-ment maturity. Some of the insights from these assessments are discussed in the

section of this chapter that describes the different maturity components. Assess-ments continue to be performed; what about your organization?
As discussed above,  organizations  have often looked for a silver  bullet to improve the alignment of IT-business; fundamental for successful BPM. Some thought the right technology (e.g., infrastructure, applications) was the answer. While important, it is not enough. Likewise, improved communications between IT and the business help, but are not enough. Similarly, establishing a partnership is not enough, nor is balanced metrics that combine appropriate business and technical measurements. More recently, governance has been touted as the answer – to identify and prioritize projects, resources, and risks. Today, we also recognize the importance of having the appropriate skills to execute and support the environment. Research has found that all six of these components must be addressed to improve alignment.
Additionally, there has not been an effective tool to gauge the maturity of the IT-business alignment – a tool that can provide both a descriptive assessment and a prescriptive roadmap on how to improve. From measuring the six components in organizations in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and India, most organi-zations today are in a low Level 3 of a ﬁve-level maturity assessment model; there are still many opportunities for improvement.
The six IT-business alignment criteria are illustrated in Fig. 2 and are described in the following section of this chapter. All six must be addressed to ensure mature
12	J. Luftman

alignment; looking for a single silver bullet answer, will just not do it. These six criteria are:
1. Communications  Maturity  –  ensuring  effective  ongoing  knowledge  sharing across organizations
2. Competency/Value Measurement Maturity – demonstrating the value of IT in terms of contribution to the business
3. Governance Maturity – ensuring that the appropriate business and IT partici-pants formally discuss and review the priorities and allocations of IT resources
4. Partnership Maturity – how each organization perceives the contribution of the other, the trust that develops among the participants and the sharing of risks and rewards
5. Scope & Architecture Maturity – The extent to which IT is able to:
•   Go beyond the back ofﬁce and into the front ofﬁce of the organization to directly impact customers/clients and strategic partners
•   Assume a role supporting a ﬂexible infrastructure that is transparent to all business partners and customers
•   Evaluate and apply emerging technologies effectively
•   Enable or drive business processes and strategies as a true standard •   Provide solutions customizable to customer needs
6. Skills Maturity – Human resource considerations such as training, salary, per-formance feedback, and career opportunities are assessed to identify how to enhance the organization’s cultural and social environment as a component of organizational effectiveness

Knowing the maturity of its strategic choices and alignment practices makes it possible for a ﬁrm to see where it stands with respect to its “alignment gaps” and how it can close these gaps. The pyramid in Fig. 3 illustrates the alignment gap on each level of alignment maturity vividly. The ﬁve levels of alignment maturity are introduced in this section and then will be elaborated in the following section of this chapter.

Level 1: Initial or ad-hoc processes. Organizations at Level 1 generally have poor communications between IT and the business and also a poor understanding of the value or contribution the other provides. Their relationships tend to be formal and rigid, and their metrics are usually technical rather than business oriented. Service level agreements tend to be sporadic. IT planning or business planning is ad-hoc. And IT is viewed as a cost center and considered “a cost of doing business.” The two parties also have minimal trust and partnership. IT projects rarely have business sponsors or champions. The business and IT also have little to no career crossovers. Applications focus on traditional back-ofﬁce support, such as e-mail, accounting, and HR, with no integration among them. Finally, Level 1 organizations do not have an aligned IT-business strategy.
Level2:Committedprocesses.OrganizationsatLevel2havebegunenhancingtheir IT-business relationship. Alignment tends to focus on functions or departments (e.g., ﬁnance, R&D, manufacturing, marketing) or geographical locations (e.g.,

U.S., Europe, Asia). The business and IT have limited understanding of each others’ responsibilities and roles. IT metrics and service levels are technical and cost-oriented, and they are not linked to business metrics. Few continuous improvement programs exist. Management interactions between IT and the business tend to be transaction-based rather than partnership-based, and IT spending relates to basic operations. Business sponsorship of IT projects is limited.Atthefunctionlevel,thereissomecareercrossoverbetweenthebusiness and IT. IT management considers technical skills the most important for IT.
Level  3:  Established,  Focused  processes.  In  Level  3  organizations,  IT  assets become more integrated enterprise-wide. Senior and mid-level IT management understand the business, and the business’s understanding of IT is emerging. Service level agreements (SLAs) begin to emerge across shared or acted upon. Strategic planning tends to be done at the business unit level, although some inter-organizational planning has begun. IT is increasingly viewed by the busi-ness as an asset, but project prioritization still usually responds to “the loudest voice.” Formal IT steering committees emerge and meet regularly. IT spending tends to be controlled by budgets, and IT is still seen as a cost center. But awareness of IT’s “investment potential” is emerging. The business is more tolerant of risk and is willing to share some risk with IT. At the function level, the business sponsors IT projects and career crossovers between business and IT occur. Both business and technical skills are important to business and IT managers. Technology standards and architecture have emerged at both the enterprise level and with key external partners.
Level 4: Improved, Managed processes. Organizations at Level 4 manage the processes they need for strategic alignment within the enterprise. One of the important attributes of this level is that the gap has closed between IT under-standing the business and the business understanding IT. As a result, Level 4 organizations have effective decision making and IT provides services that reinforce the concept of IT as a value center. Level 4 organizations leverage their IT assets enterprise-wide, and they focus applications on enhancing business
14	J. Luftman

processes for sustainable competitive advantage. SLAs are also enterprise-wide, and benchmarking is a routine practice. Strategic business and IT planning processes are managed across the enterprise. Formal IT steering committees meet regularly and are effective at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels. The business views IT as a valued service provider and as an enabler (or driver) of change. In fact, the business shares risks and rewards with IT by providing effective sponsorship and championing all IT projects. Overall, change manage-ment is highly effective. Career crossovers between business and IT occur across functions, with business and technical skills recognized as very important to the business and IT.
Level 5: Optimized processes. Organizations at Level 5 have optimized strategic IT-business alignment through rigorous governance processes that integrate strategic business planning and IT planning. Alignment goes beyond the enter-prise by leveraging IT with the company’s business partners, customers, and clients, as well. IT has extended its reach to encompass the value chains of external customers and suppliers. Relationships between the business and IT are informal, and knowledge is shared with external partners. Business metrics, IT metrics, and SLAs also extend to external partners, and benchmarking is rou-tinely performed with these partners. Strategic business and IT planning are integrated across the organization, as well as outside the organization.

Figure 4 summarizes the results of the 362 Global 1,000 companies that have gone through the assessment to date. It illustrates where there is relative agreement regarding which areas are strong and which are weak, and it identiﬁes the gaps between business and IT executive’s opinions. The Y-axis represents the ﬁve levels of maturity; the X-axis expands each of the six components of maturity. This ﬁgure clearly identiﬁes the maturity elements as the strongest and those that are assessed as the lowest (hence the areas leased aligned). A summary of the responses IT executives and corresponding assessments from business executives can also be observed. The areas where the IT and business executive responses/lines converge or overlap depict areas where there is the most agreement (and thus synergy) between business and IT. Conversely, areas with large gaps between the respective responses/lines are the ones that show disagreement among IT and business exec-utives; these are area that need to be reconciled. For example, Fig. 4 illustrates a tighter synergy between business and IT in the areas of partnership and skills than for communications. The major elements will be discussed later in this chapter.
Figure 5 summarizes these results by region. A general trend that Fig. 5 illus-trates is that across most components, Asian organizations have higher maturity scores, followed by American and Latin American organizations, and then Euro-pean organizations. The pattern of maturity scores for Australian organizations (denoted by the thick line) reveals that in some dimensions they score as high as or higher than Asian organizations, while for other dimensions they score lower than all other regions. (Since there is only one African organization is represented in the data, no trends for African organizations are assumed.)
With an overall average maturity score of 3.09, it is clear that there are still opportunities to improve the IT business relationship; alignment is not dead.

Fig. 4  Overall SAM assessment maturity

A similar graph may be used to plot the responses from an individual organiza-tions assessment to identify opportunities for improvement (using the assessment as a prescriptive tool) and to benchmark things such as how a speciﬁc organization compares to:

•   the overall average set of responses
•   the responses from exemplar organizations
•   other organizations in their industry (Finance, Pharmaceutical, Utility, Retail, Health Care, Education)
•   respondents from similar positions (e.g., CIO’s, CEO’s, CFO’s,) in other ﬁrms

Once the maturity level is understood, the assessment method provides the organization with a prescriptive roadmap that identiﬁes opportunities for enhancing the harmonious relationship of business and IT. This alignment process is expanded in this chapter.


4   The Six Strategic Alignment Maturity Criteria

This part of the chapter describes each of the six components (illustrated in Fig. 2) that are evaluated in deriving the level of strategic alignment maturity. Examples taken from actual assessments illustrate the kinds of insights that can be identiﬁed. Most organizations today appear to be around a level 3, as illustrated in Fig. 6.

Fig. 5  Geographic SAM summary

That means that the average results from the 362 Global 1,000 companies’ formal  assessments  (and  the  several  hundred  additional  informal  assessments from multiple years of Society for Information Management surveys) to date are around a level 3. A gradual increase in the overall maturity level over the past decade can be observed Table 1. The results are similar to what has been found by the  Carnegie  Software  Engineering  Institute  development  process  model  that assesses the comparable stages of application development maturity.
So, while IT business alignment seems to be improving, it is still a pervasive persistent problem. Naturally, the objective of the Strategic Alignment Maturity model is to identify opportunities to move the organization to a higher level (i.e., higher than a Level 3) of Strategic Alignment Maturity. Keep in mind that the primary  objective  of  the  assessment  is  not  the  maturity  level  used  just  as  a descriptive tool of an organizations maturity; albeit it provides interesting bench-mark  comparisons.  The  primary  objective  of  the  assessment  is  to  understand (as illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5) where IT and business executives:
–  agree that a criteria needs to be improved
–  agree that a criteria is good, but can be better –  disagree with how good/bad a criteria is
–  desire to focus their efforts to improve

As illustrated in Fig. 5, there were differences in the overall SAM alignment scores by region. On average, Asian organizations had higher scores than their
Strategic Alignment Maturity	17

Fig. 6  Distribution of SAM scores










American, Australian, and European counterparts. The SAM scores by criteria and by region are summarized in Table 2, below. It is valuable to benchmark organi-zations by geography as well as comparing alignment trends across the geogra-phies. This will be discussed later in this chapter.
When there is agreement among the participants regarding the criteria assess-ment, the model can be used as a prescriptive roadmap to identify how alignment maturity can be improved. However, when there is disagreement, the key stake-holders (i.e. any groups or individuals who can affect or are affected by IT in the ﬁrm) need to understand the points-of-view of the participants and come to an agreement regarding the criteria and how to enhance it. The organization cannot identify an appropriate road to take if they cannot come to agreement regarding where they want to go. Once the group has identiﬁed an agreed to list of areas for improvement, they can proceed to use the model as a prescriptive roadmap. Hence, itis notthe maturity “number” that is important. Itiswhat theorganization does as a result of identifying how they can work together to improve the alignment maturity. The next six sub-sections discuss each of the Strategic Alignment Maturity criteria in more detail and include examples of how they manifest themselves in organizations. These examples have been abstracted from recent research done with a number of major U.S. and global organizations (Luftman and Zadeh 2011). Table 3 summarizes the data from this research across the six SAM components by industry. In terms of their alignment maturity, it is evident that industries can vary  considerably  in  their  overall  scores.  For  example,  the  service  sector out-performed the transportation sector by an overall score of 3.31 to 2.84, while the gap between the retail and educational sectors was almost a full point (3.62
vs. 2.63).
Since this research is still ongoing and the companies that have participated have been assured anonymity, it is not possible to share the speciﬁc names of the participating organizations. However, each section illustrates speciﬁc issues of strategic alignment maturity that have been uncovered in the research and identiﬁes the industry of the participating organizations.

Strategic Alignment Maturity	21

4.1	Communications

Effective exchange of ideas and a clear understanding of the key ideas that ensure successful strategies are high on the list of enablers and inhibitors to alignment. Too often there is little business awareness on the part of IT or little IT appreciation on the part of the business. The 362 Global 1,000 benchmark ﬁrm results indicate that 21 % of the IT organizations either do not understand or have a limited understand-ing of business; while 39 % of the business executives either do not understand or have a limited understanding of IT. Given the dynamic environment in which most organizations ﬁnd themselves, ensuring ongoing knowledge sharing across organi-zations is paramount.
Many ﬁrms choose to employ people in formal inter-unit “liaison” roles or cross-functional teams to facilitate this knowledge sharing. The key word here is “facil-itate”. Some organizations have facilitators whose role is to serve as the sole conduit of interaction among the different units of the organization. This approach tends to stiﬂe rather than foster effective communications. Rigid protocols that impede discussions and the sharing of ideas should be avoided. The 362 Global 1,000 benchmark ﬁrm results indicate that 54 % of the ﬁrms identify liaisons as a major opportunity for improvement.
For example, a large aerospace company assessed its communications alignment maturity  at  level  2.  Business-IT  understanding  is  sporadic.  The  relationship between IT and the business function could be improved. Improving communica-tion should focus on how to create the understanding of IT as a strategic business partner by the businesses it supports rather than simply a service provider. The ﬁrm’s CIO made the comment that there is “no constructive partnership”. However, in an interview with the ﬁrm’s Director of IT Infrastructure, he stated that he views his organization as a “strategic business partner”. One way to improve communi-cations  and,  more  importantly,  understanding,  would be  to  establish  effective business function/IT liaisons that facilitate sharing of knowledge and ideas.
In a second case, a large ﬁnancial services company’s communication alignment maturity placed it in level 2 with some attributes of Level 1. Business awareness within IT is through specialized IT business analysts, who understand and translate the business needs to other IT staff (i.e., there is limited awareness of business by general IT staff). Awareness of IT by the ﬁrm’s business functions, is also limited, although senior and mid-level management are aware of IT’s potential. Communi-cations are achieved through bi-weekly priority meetings of the senior and middle level managers from both groups, where they discuss requirements, priorities and IT implementation. But it is still a 2 because of the effectiveness of the interaction. In a third example, a large utility company’s communication alignment maturity places it at a level 2. Communications are not open until circumstances force the business to identify speciﬁc needs. There is a lack of trust and openness among some business units and their IT team. IT business partners tend to be bottlenecks in meeting commitments. IT’s poor performance in previous years left scars that have
not healed.
22	J. Luftman

From a geographic perspective (as illustrated in Table 2) Asian organizations achieved the highest level of maturity in the communications component with an overall score of 3.52, followed by Latin America with a score of 3.17. The United States, Australia, and European scores were 2.93, 2.88, and 2.85, respectively.


4.2	Competency/Value Measurements

Too many IT organizations cannot demonstrate their value to the business in terms that the business understands. Frequently business and IT metrics of value differ. A balanced “dashboard” that demonstrates the value of IT in terms of contribution to the business isneeded(see alsovomBrocke and Sonnenberg 2014). The 362 Global 1,000 benchmark ﬁrm results indicate that two-thirds of the ﬁrms can improve this important area.
Service levels that assess IT’s commitments to the business often help.However, the service levels have to be expressed in terms that the business understands and accepts. The service levels should be tied to criteria (see criteria 4. Partnership, below) that clearly deﬁne the rewards and penalties for surpassing or missing the objectives. The 362 Global 1,000 benchmark ﬁrm results indicate that 63 % of the ﬁrms can signiﬁcantly improve their SLAs.
Frequently organizations devote signiﬁcant resources to measuring performance factors. However, they spend much less of their resources on taking actions based on these measurements. For example, an organization that requires analyzing ROI before a project begins, but then does not review how well objectives were met after the project was deployed provides little to the project’s success. It is important to assess these criteria to understand (1) the factors that lead to missing the criteria and (2) what can be learned to improve the environment continuously.
For example, a large aerospace company assessed its competency/value mea-surement maturity to be at a level 2. IT operates as cost center. IT metrics are focused at the functional level, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are technical in nature. One area that could help to improve maturity would be to add more business-related metrics to SLAs to help form more of a partnership between IT and the business units. Periodic formal assessments and reviews in support of contin-uous improvement would also be beneﬁcial.
A large software development company assessed its competency/value measure-ment maturity at level 3. Established metrics evaluate the extent of service provided to the business functions. These metrics go beyond basic service availability and help  desk  responsiveness,  evaluating  such  issues  as  end-user  satisfaction  and application  development  effectiveness. The  metrics  are  consolidated  on  to  an overall  dashboard.  However,  because  no  formal  feedback  mechanisms  are  in place to react to a metric, the dashboard cannot be considered to be managed.
At a large ﬁnancial services company, IT competency/value was assessed at a level 2 because the company uses cost efﬁciency methods within the business and functional organizations. Balanced metrics are emerging through linked business
Strategic Alignment Maturity	23

and IT metrics, and a balanced scorecard is provided to senior management. Service level agreements are technical at the functional level. Benchmarking is not gener-ally practiced and is informal in the few areas where it is practiced. Formal assessments  are  done typically for problems  and minimum  measurements are taken after the assessment of failures.
Table 2 shows signiﬁcantly different IT competency SAM scores across regions. Asian organizations lead the way with an overall score of 3.59, followed by Australian ﬁrms with a score of 3.01; Latin American ﬁrms (2.94) are followed closely by American ﬁrms (2.93). European organizations scored the lowest in this dimension, with a score of 2.63.



4.3	Governance

The considerations for IT governance were deﬁned brieﬂy in Fig. 1. Ensuring that the  appropriate  business  and  IT  participants  formally  discuss  and  review  the priorities and allocation of IT resources is among the most important enablers/ inhibitors of alignment. This decision-making authority needs to be clearly deﬁned. The 362 Global 1,000 benchmark ﬁrm results indicate that 57 % of the ﬁrms should be improving this important component of alignment.
For example, IT governance in a large aerospace company is tactical at the core business level and not consistent across the enterprise. For this reason, they reported a level 2 maturity assessment. IT can be characterized as reactive to CEO direction. Developing an integrated enterprise-wide strategic business plan for IT would facilitate better partnering within the ﬁrm and would lay the groundwork for external partnerships with customers and suppliers.
A large communications manufacturing company assessed its governance matu-rity at a level falling between 1 and 2. IT does little strategic planning because it operates as a cost center and, therefore, cost reduction is a key objective. In addition, priorities are reactive to business needs as business manager’s request services.
A large computing services company assessed their governance maturity at a level 1+. A strategic planning committee meets twice a year. The committee consists of corporate top management with  regional representation. Topics or results are neither discussed nor published to all employees. The reporting structure is federated with the CIO reporting to a COO. IT investments are traditionally made to supportoperations and maintenance. Regionalor corporate sponsors are involved with some projects. Prioritization is occasionally responsive.
From a geographic perspective (as illustrated in Table 2) Asian organizations achieved the highest level of maturity in the governance component with an overall score of 3.58. Australian organizations came in second with a score of 3.15, followed  by  American  companies  with  a  score  of  3.07.  Latin  American  and European organizations earned scores of 3.03 and 2.94, respectively.
24	J. Luftman

4.4	Partnership

The relationship that exists between the business and IT organizations is another criterion that ranks high among the enablers and inhibitors. Giving the IT function the opportunity to have an equal role in deﬁning business strategies is obviously important. However, how each organization perceives the contribution of the other, the trust that develops among the participants, ensuring appropriate business spon-sors and champions of IT endeavors, and the sharing of risks and rewards are all major contributors to mature alignment. This partnership should evolve to a point where IT both enables AND drives changes to both business processes and strate-gies. Naturally, this demands having a good business design where the CIO and CEO share a clearly deﬁned vision.
For example, a large software development company assessed their partnership maturity at a level of 2. The IT function is mainly an enabler for the company. But IT does not have a seat at the business table, either with the enterprise or with the business function that is making decisions. In the majority of cases, there are no shared risks because only the business will fail. Indications are that the partnership criterion will rise from a level 2–3 as top management sees IT as an asset, and because of the very high enforcement of standards at the company.
Partnership for a large communications manufacturing company was assessed at level 1. IT is perceived as a cost of being in the communications business. Little value is placed on the IT function. IT is perceived only as help desk support and network maintenance.
For a large utility company, partnership maturity was assessed at a level of 1+. IT charges back all expenses to the business. Most business executives see IT as a cost of doing business. There is heightened awareness that IT can be a critical enabler to success, but there is minimal acceptance of IT as a partner.
Partnership  for a  large  computing  services  company  was  assessed  at  level 2. Since the business executives pursued e-commerce, IT is seen as a business process enabler as demonstrated by the Web development. Unfortunately, the business now assigns IT with the risks of the project. Most IT projects have an IT sponsor.
From a geographic perspective (as illustrated in Table 2), Asian organizations havea partnership maturityscore of3.64. Thenextclosest regionwas LatinAmerica, with a partnership score of (3.16). The American, Australian, and European partner-ship scores were 3.09, 2.96, and 2.78, respectively.



4.5	Scope and Architecture

This set of criteria tends to assess information technology maturity and the ﬁtness of IT assets to support business process (see “IT use process” in Fig. 1). Therefore, these criteria assess the extent to which IT is able to:
Strategic Alignment Maturity	25

•   Go beyond the back ofﬁce and into the front ofﬁce of the organization
•   Assume a role supporting a ﬂexible infrastructure that is transparent to all business partners and customers
•   Evaluate and apply emerging technologies effectively
•   Enable or drive business processes and strategies as a true standard •   Provide solutions customizable to customer needs

Scope  and  Architecture  was  assessed  at a  level of  2+  at  a  large  software development company. This is another area where the company is moving from a level 2 to a level 3. ERP systems are installed and all projects are monitored at an enterprise level. Standards are integrated across the organization and enterprise architecture is integrated. It is only in the area of Inter-enterprise that there is no formal integration.
A large ﬁnancial services company assessed their scope and architecture at level 1. Although standards are deﬁned, there is no formal integration across the enter-prise. At best, only functional integration exists.
Once again, Asian companies led in this dimension, scoring 3.6 for the scope & architecture component. Latin America came in second, with a score of 3.27, followed by the United States, which scored 3.12. European and Australian orga-nizations scored 3.01 and 2.96, respectively.



4.6	Skills

Skills were deﬁned in Fig. 1. They include all of the human resource considerations for the organization. Going beyond the traditional considerations such as training, salary, performance feedback, and career opportunities are factors that include the organization’s cultural and social environment. Is the organization ready for change in this dynamic environment? Do individuals feel personally responsible for busi-ness innovation? Can individuals and organizations learn quickly from their expe-rience?  Does  the  organization  leverage  innovative  ideas  and  the  spirit  of entrepreneurship? These are some of the important conditions of mature organiza-tions. The 362 Global 1,000 benchmark ﬁrm results indicate that 55 % of the benchmarked  ﬁrms  do  not  effectively  support  career  crossover  opportunities (IT into the business and the business into IT) and that 55 % of the benchmarked ﬁrms do not effectively support education cross training.
For example, a large aerospace company assesses their skills maturity at a level 2. A deﬁnite command and control management style exists within IT and the businesses. Power resides within certain operating companies. Diverse business cultures  abound.  Getting  to a  non-political,  trusting  environment  between the businesses and IT, where risks are shared and innovation and entrepreneurship thrive, is essential to achieve improvements in each of the other maturity tenets. Organizational behavior research has demonstrated that sharing information that is
26	J. Luftman

based on expertise is often the most successful approach to inﬂuencing others to cooperate and trust one another (Luftman 1997).
Skills maturity at a large computing services company is assessed at a level of 1. Career crossover is not encouraged outside of top management. Innovation is dependent on the business unit, but in general is not encouraged. Management style is dependent on the business unit, but is usually command and control. Training is encouraged but left up to the individual employee.
Finally, from a geographical perspective, Asian companies earned a maturity score of 3.55. Latin American organizations came in second, earning a score of 3.00. American, European, and Australian organizations received SAM Skill scores of 2.84, 2.70, and 2.68, respectively.



4.7	Results by Geography and Industry

As noted above, results from the assessment from the 362 Global 1,000 companies by region reveal higher alignment scores by Asian organizations across all maturity components. As a group, they scored 3.58, as compared to3.00for theUnitedStates and 2.82 for Europe. A complete illustration of regional SAM scores by component is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5.
What was it that made Asian organizations score higher in every SAM compo-nent than their European, American, and Latin American counterparts? An exam-ination of the factors that have led to the remarkable success of India’s service sector  offers  several  lessons.  A  strong  culture  that  promotes  communication between employees, the emphasis of CMM/CMMI-based continuous improvement efforts, and well-planned strategies that promote organizational ﬂexibility are just some of the factors that are fundamental.
An analysis of SAM data shows that the retail, hotel/entertainment, service, and insurance sectors performed well above the average SAM score of 3.09 in all dimensions. As noted in Table 3, these industries scored 3.62, 3.44, 3.31, and 3.26, respectively. (Note – there were relatively few retail and hotel/entertainment companies in the sample, however.) The well-represented industry in the Global 1,000 was the ﬁnancial industry, which earned an overall SAM rating of 3.01. The manufacturing industry performed closest to the mean, with an overall average of 3.13.

5   Levels of Strategic Alignment Maturity

5.1	Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc Process

Organizations that are at Strategic Alignment Maturity Level 1 can be characterized as having the lowest level of Strategic Alignment Maturity. For example: in the “Communications” criteria of the model, understanding of the business by IT is very low (see the “Communications” criteria box in Fig. 7). Similarly, the attribute called “Understanding of IT by the business” is also very low for an organization at Level 1 maturity.
It is highly improbable that these organizations will be able to achieve an aligned IT business strategy, leaving their investment in IT signiﬁcantly unleveraged. See Fig. 7 for the speciﬁc criteria for Level 1.

Fig. 8  Level 2 Strategic Alignment Maturity criteria


5.2	Level 2: Committed Process

Level 2 organizations can be characterized as having committed to begin the process  for  Strategic  Alignment  Maturity.  For  example:  in  the  “Competency/ Value Measurements” criteria of the model, IT metrics (an “attribute”) are focused on cost and efﬁciency (see the “Competency/Value Measurements” criteria box in Fig. 8). Similarly, in the “Partnership” criteria of the model, the business perception of  IT  (again,  another  “attribute”)  is  that  IT  is  emerging  as  an  asset  to  the organization.
This level of Strategic Alignment Maturity tends to be directed at local situations or functional organizations (e.g., Marketing, Finance, Manufacturing, H/R) within the overall enterprise. However, due to limited awareness by the business and IT communities of the different functional organizations use of IT, alignment can be difﬁcult to achieve. Any business-IT alignment at the local level is typically not leveraged by the enterprise. However, the potential opportunities are beginning to be recognized. See Fig. 8 for the speciﬁc criteria for Level 2.



5.3	Level 3: Established Focused Process

This level of Strategic Alignment Maturity concentrates on governance, processes and communications towards speciﬁc business objectives. The reasons for this focus are:
Strategic Alignment Maturity	29





















Fig. 9  Level 3 Strategic Alignment Maturity criteria

•   The organization needs better decision-making processes (governance) around which business processes to invest scarce IT dollars
•   The organization wants to focus on those business processes that generate the most long-lasting competitive advantage (and presumably, proﬁtability), and
•   The organization has to effectively communicate its vision and get “buy-in” from all employees and management

IT is becoming embedded in the business. Level 3 leverages IT assets on an enterprise-wide  basis  and  applications  systems  demonstrate  planned,  managed direction away from traditional transaction processing to systems that use informa-tion to make business decisions. The IT “extrastructure” (leveraging the inter-organizational infrastructure) is evolving with key partners. For example: in the “Communications” criteria of the model, the sharing of knowledge (an “attribute”) tends to be structured around key processes (see the “Communications” criteria box in Fig. 9). Similarly, in the “Governance” criteria of the model, the prioritization process (again, another “attribute”) tends to be reactive. See the Fig. 9 for the speciﬁc criteria for Level 3.

sustainable competitive advantage. A Level 4 organization views IT as an innova-tive and imaginative strategic contributor to success. The enterprise-wide emphasis of Level 4 organizations breaks down the “process silos” that exist among business units in lower level organizations in order to capitalize on the information and knowledge embedded in an organization’s business processes and practices. Level 4 organizations also utilize IT “hard” (i.e., hardware and software) and “soft” assets (e.g., knowledge and information about customers, competitors and products and employee  skills)  by  consciously  deploying  enterprise-wide  architectures.  One example of such architecture might be an enterprise intranet portal for collecting, categorizing and sharing customer/product information as well as unstructured information (e.g., web URLs, journal articles, etc.) about competitor products.
This level of Strategic Alignment Maturity demonstrates effective governance and services that reinforce the concept of IT as a value center. For example: in the “Communications” criteria of the model, the sharing of knowledge (an “attribute”) is institutionalized. Similarly, in the “Scope and Architecture” criteria of the model, the organization has established enterprise standards. See the Fig. 10 for the speciﬁc criteria for Level 4.

customers/clients and suppliers/partners. For a Level 5 organization, it is often difﬁcult to determine if they are more an information technology company than a commercial company (e.g., securities, insurance, travel (e.g., Travelocity), retail (e.g., Amazon)).
A sustained governance process integrates the IT strategic planning process with the strategic business process. For example:in the “Communications” criteria of the model, “understanding of the business by IT” and “understanding of IT by the business” (two elements) are pervasive. Similarly, in the “Skills” criteria of the model, “Innovation and Entrepreneurship” are the norm for the organization. See the Fig. 11 for the speciﬁc criteria for Level 5.



6   Assessing Strategic Alignment Maturity

An essential part of the assessment process is recognizing that it must be done with a team including both business and IT executives. The convergence on a consensus of the maturity levels and the discussions that ensue are extremely valuable in understanding the problems and opportunities that need to be addressed to improve business-IT alignment. As previously discussed, the most important part of the process is the creation of speciﬁc recommendations that address the problems and opportunities identiﬁed from the assessment. The most difﬁcult step, of course, is actually carrying out the recommendations. This section ties the assessment metrics
32	J. Luftman

together. The examples and experiences provided in the preceding section on the Six Strategic Alignment Criteria, together with the procedure described in the next section, served as the vehicle for validating the model.
Each of the criteria and levels are described by a set of attributes that allow a particular dimension to be assessed using a 1–5 Likert scale, where:
1 ¼ this does not ﬁt the organization, or the organization is very ineffective 2 ¼ low level of ﬁt for the organization
3 ¼ moderate ﬁt for the organization, or the organization is moderately effective 4 ¼ this ﬁts most of the organization
5 ¼ strong level of ﬁt throughout the organization, or the organization is very effective

Different scales can be applied to perform the assessment (e.g., good, fair, poor; 1, 2, 3). However, whatever the scale, it is important to evaluate each of the six criteria with both business and IT executives to obtain accurate assessment per-spectives. The intent is to have the team of IT and business executives converge on a maturity level. Typically, the initial review will produce divergent results. This outcome is indicative of the problems/opportunities being addressed. A summary of the 362 Global 1,000 companies’ results for all six components and their respective criteria can be found in Figs. 4 and 5.
The relative importance of each of the attributes within the criteria may differ among organizations. For example, in some organizations the use of SLAs (Service Level Agreements) might not be considered as important to alignment as the effectiveness of liaisons. Hence, giving SLAs a low maturity assessment should not signiﬁcantly impact the overall rating in this case. However, it would be valuable if the group discussed why the organization does not consider a particular attribute (in this example, SLAs) to be signiﬁcant.
Using a Delphi approach with a Group Decision Support Tool often helps in attaining the convergence (Luftman 1997). Experience suggests that “discussions” among the different team members helps to ensure a clearer understanding of the problems and opportunities that need to be addressed.
Keep in mind that the primary objective of the assessment is to identify speciﬁc recommendations to improve the alignment of IT and the business. The evaluation team, after assessing each of the six criteria from level one to ﬁve, uses the results to converge on an overall assessment level of the maturity for the ﬁrm. They apply the next higher level of maturity as a prescriptive roadmap to identify what they could/ should do next. A trained facilitator is typically needed for these sessions.
As previously discussed, there have been over 362 Global 1,000 organizations from around the world (and several hundred smaller companies) and 2,100 business and IT executives that have participated in formally assessing their IT business alignment maturity. As illustrated in Figs. 4, 5, and 6, the average level of maturity is about a 3. Given the number of companies that have participated exemplar benchmarks based on factors such as industry, company age, company size, and job tiles have been factored into the research to obtain their effect on alignment maturity. Some of the benchmark insights have been discussed in this chapter.

7   Strategic Alignment as a Process

Attaining and sustaining business-IT alignment must ﬁrst focus on understanding the current level of Strategic Alignment Maturity; followed by steps that concen-trate organizational energy on maximizing alignment enablers and minimizing inhibitors. This process embraces the steps (Henderson and Venkatraman 1996) illustrated by Fig. 12 and elaborated in the following text.
1. Set the goals and establish a team. Ensure that there is an executive business sponsor and champion for the assessment. Next, assign a team of both business and IT leaders. Obtaining appropriate representatives from the major business functional organizations (e.g., Marketing, Finance, R&D, and Engineering) is critical to the success of the assessment. The purpose of the team is to evaluate the maturity of the business-IT alignment. Once the maturity is understood, the team is expected to deﬁne opportunities for enhancing the harmonious relation-ship of business and IT. Assessments  range from three to twelve half-day sessions. The time demanded depends on the number of participants, the degree of consensus required, and the detail of the recommendations to carry out.
2. Understand the business-IT linkage. The Strategic Alignment Maturity Assess-ment is an important tool in understanding the business-IT linkage. The team evaluates each of the six criteria. This can be done via executive interviews, group discussion, a questionnaire, or a combination. A trained facilitator can be valuable in guiding the important discussions.

34	J. Luftman

3. Analyze and prioritize gaps. Recognize that the different opinions raised by the participants are indicative of the alignment opportunities that exist. Once under-stood, the group needs to converge on a maturity level. The team must remember that the purpose of this step is to understand the activities necessary to improve the business-IT linkage. The gaps between where the organization is today and where the team believes it needs to be are the gaps that need to be prioritized. Apply the next higher level of maturity as a roadmap to identify what can be done next.
4. Specify the actions (project management). Knowing where the organization is with regards to alignment maturity will drive what speciﬁc actions are appro-priate to enhance IT-business alignment. Assign speciﬁc remedial tasks with clearly deﬁned deliverables, ownership, timeframes, resources, risks, and mea-surements to each of the prioritized gaps.
5. Choose and evaluate success criteria. This step necessitates revisiting the goals and regularly discussing the measurement criteria identiﬁed to evaluate the implementation of the project plans. The review of the measurements should serve as a learning vehicle to understand how and why the objectives are or are not being met.
6. Sustain alignment. Some problems just won’t go away. Why are so many of the inhibitors IT related? Obtaining IT-business alignment is a difﬁcult task. This last step in the process is often the most difﬁcult. To sustain the beneﬁt from IT, an  “alignment  behavior”  must  be  developed  and  cultivated.  The  criteria described to assess alignment maturity provides characteristics of organizations that link IT and business strategies. By adopting these behaviors, companies can increase their potential for a more mature alignment assessment and improve their ability to gain business value from investments in IT. Hence, the continued focus onunderstandingthe alignment maturity for an organization and taking the necessary action to improve the IT-business harmony are keys. Implicit in this is to periodically repeat the process to see how the organization evolves over time.
Fundamental to the effective use of the Strategic Alignment Maturity assessment is to not only measure the maturity level of IT-business alignment but also to identify the problem/opportunity areas; and more important use the model as a roadmap to deﬁne speciﬁc initiatives for improvement. Repeating the assessment periodically can be insightful.
For example, when the strategic alignment maturity model was ﬁrst used to assess the level of alignment maturity for a large ﬁnancial company (ﬁctitiously referred to as Stonehenge), they were assessed at a Level 2 (Committed Processes). At the time, Stonehenge had recently adopted the federated IT organization model, so noone considered that theIT organization structure would be the area to consider in identifying why this ﬁnancial giant was only at level 2. After all, the federal (or hybrid) IT organization design has been found to produce higher alignment maturity scores over centralized and decentralized IT organization alternatives; because it captures the beneﬁts of both centralized and decentralized IT organiza-tions. The federated IT organization deployed at Stonehenge essentially centralized
Strategic Alignment Maturity	35

IT architecture and common systems, while decentralizing the strategic business unit applications and resources. The centralized IT structure supports the develop-ment of strong and efﬁcient IT infrastructures while the decentralized IT group fosters  business-IT  relationships.  Following  the  above  logic,  Stonehenge  had decentralized its formally centralized application development staff, expecting that the relationships with the business management would improve. However, the analysis of the Stonehenge SAM assessment data showed that:

•   The indicators that measure the understanding of business by IT and the under-standing of IT by business, which are covered in the “communications” area of the SAM model, were very low. Knowledge sharing in the organization was at a minimum  to  none.  IT  and  business  met  occasionally  (only  during  major walkthroughs) in a formal setting.
•   IT-business relationship and trust measures that are covered under the “partner-ship” area were also at the minimum. Business viewed IT as a cost of doing business. There was an ongoing conﬂict between business and IT; they blamed each other for every late or unsuccessful delivery.
•   Competency metrics –measuring value of IT area showed that IT operated as a cost center.
•   Social-interaction indicator, which is covered under the HR area, was pointing to minimal IT-business interaction.
These and several other criteria used in the assessment suggested that there was conﬂict in the IT-business relationship in Stonehenge and that trust levels were at a minimum – typical in a centralized IT organization with poor linkages between business and IT. The fact that the company had already adopted the federated model motivated managers to further analyze the data to ﬁnd out why the relationship with the business management did not improve.
Several other indicators, such as the differences between the IT and the business managers’ opinions and the differences between the top and the middle managers’ opinions in the SAM model pointed to the problem in the implementation of the federated  model.  Looking  at  the  organization  charts  and  the  grouping  of  the departments, they seemed in line with the federated model, meaning that the application development groups were created within the business units and dual reporting relationship for the divisional IT heads were created. Yet, the location of the development teams and the way they were functioning were not different from what they would be like in a typical centralized IT organization. At the end of the study, it was apparent that the management couldn’t diverge from the routine they followed  for  many  years.  Indicators  such  as  the  tendency  of  the  employees’ resistance to change  (measured  in the HR area) were also in support of this hypothesis.
As illustrated in this example, SAM not only helped identify Stonehenge’s’ maturity score, but it also allowed managers to identify speciﬁc problems and opportunities to improve the IT-business alignment. Once again, organizations should not be in pursuit of a silver bullet. All six components of alignment maturity should be considered to determine the areas that require improvements and the
36	J. Luftman

opportunities that exist to help improve the IT-business alignment maturity level of the organization.
The periodical SAM measurement and results at Stonehenge are reviewed by both business and IT managers to ensure appropriate alignment. SAM provides guidance for business changes as well for a better alignment. SAM assessment should be considered as a continuous process of improvement in the organizations facing  turbulent  changes  in  business  environment  to  enable  organization-led increased strategic alignment maturity in the organization.



8   Strategic Alignment Maturity and Business Performance

The concept of performance underlies a lot of the research in strategic management and information science. A broader conceptualization of business performance would include emphasis on indicators of operational performance in addition to indicators  of  ﬁnancial  performance.  Under  this  conceptualization  it  would  be logical to treat measurements such as market-share, new product introduction, product quality, marketing effectiveness, manufacturing value-added, and other measurements   of   technological   efﬁciency   within   the   domain   of   business performance.
Research done by Luftman, et al., validated the contribution of Strategic Align-ment Maturity (SAM) to company performance based on the data gathered from 362 global organizations across four continents. The research identiﬁed that the six SAM components (Communications, IT Governance, Value, Partnership, Technol-ogy Scope, and Skills) have approximately equal contribution to form the overall SAM score and they are strongly correlated to each other, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Regarding the relationship of SAM and company performance, the regression weight (.34) for SAM in the prediction of Performance is signiﬁcant, hence this proves the contribution of strategic alignment maturity as a major contributor to a company’s performance (see Fig. 13). This relationship was found to be valid across all industry types, cultures, and geographic locations.
In addition, research has shown that the organization’s structure – whether it follows a centralized, decentralized, or federated model – also has an impact on SAM maturity (see Fig. 13). Notably, companies with federated IT structures are able to combine the beneﬁts of centralized structures (such as standardization and economies of scale) and decentralized structures (local ﬂexibility and control). These companies tend to have higher alignment maturity ratings (Luftman 2007; Luftman and Zadeh 2011).
This relationship also supports the contention that achieving alignment is not a matter of addressing a single “magic bullet” issue. If IT-business alignment leads to better performing organizations, then the implication is inescapable. An organiza-tion that ﬁxates on one component at the expense of others is all but certain to be an underperforming organization.

Fig. 13  Structural equation: IT value & SAM

This  research  builds  upon  the  work  done  in  1993  by  Henderson  and Venkatraman, whose strategic alignment framework was based on four compo-nents: business strategy, IT strategy, organizational infrastructure, and IT infra-structure. This was the ﬁrst time that a strategic alignment framework was used by both researchers as well as practitioners in the ﬁeld.
As an example of the relevance of alignment for business results, Figs. 14 and 15 provide signiﬁcant insights regarding the correlation between pharmaceutical com-panies ranking based on their alignment maturity score and the respective ranking of sales and productivity. Nine pharmaceutical companies are represented. It is clear that the higher the alignment maturity, the higher the respective ranking for the success of the company.
There is no better example than the success of Indian IT Service Companies to illustrate the signiﬁcant contribution SAM has on the business performance. Given the  consistently higher SAM  scores  for the  Indian  IT service companies,  the remainder of this section will elaborate on many of our observations from working with these ﬁrms. For example, see Figs. 16 and 17 for SAM’s contributions to Indian IT Service Companies.
The rise of Indian service companies has been a notable success when measured against other service companies from other geographic regions in standard indica-tors such as sales, exports, and employment. There is no single element that has contributed to the accomplishment of these ﬁrms but, elements such as legal

transparency, education, culture, population base, low labor costs, and quality have all contributed to their success. The growth of IT service ﬁrms has been possible not just because India is a less expensive alternative, but also because of the well planned strategy of building and marketing the domain skills adopted by these companies.  Leaders  of  these  service  companies  have  carried  out  successful

software  process  management  capabilities,  and  the  ability  to  manage  global operations.
IT Metrics: Demonstrating process quality and expertise in IT service delivery are the key elements driving India’s sustained leadership in global IT services. From the birth of the industry, there has been a culture of quality. Various quality control and process management tools have been developed and improved in India. Indian IT service ﬁrms have been focusing on quality initiatives to ensure compli-ance with international standards. ISO 9001, COPC, Six Sigma are examples of some of the established quality initiatives. In fact, 90 out of the world’s 117 SEI CMM Level 5 companies are from India (NASSCOM Strategic Review 2007); albeit their overall SAM is at 3.7. This implies that while India is exemplary in tactical and operational aspects of IT, they still have opportunities to improve in strategic areas.
Over the years, the Indian IT service industry has built robust processes and procedures to offer world class IT software and technology related services by developing next-generation tools, technology concepts, and standards. The quality of the software has not only impacted India directly (e.g., making India a favored destination for IT enabled services), it has also impacted the overall IT ﬁeld by raising the software quality bar for all IT applications and services.
Indian IT service ﬁrms have a reputation for better, faster, and cheaper project delivery. These ﬁrms hire top talent who they immediately provide training in their SEI CMM Level 5 standardized methodology. They follow rigorous processes, employing quality management techniques and using the latest technology. They have developed a new generation of project-management skills that enables work to be carried out from multiple locations simultaneously. Core to this global delivery model is a heavy emphasis on quality standard.
Human Resources/Skills: Low-cost, highly skilled IT professionals are widely believed to be the key to India’s success story. India has the single largest pool of engineering talent among the emerging countries. Over 50 % of the population in India is less than 25 years old. India’s young demographic proﬁle is a unique advantage, complemented by a vast network of academic infrastructure and the legacy effects of British colonization. These have all contributed to an unmatched mix and scale of educated, English speaking talent. 80 % of the IT professionals have engineering degrees. Having engineering degrees has helped IT service ﬁrms with problem solving skills, a rigorous method of thinking logically, and in learning tools that helps in adapting quickly with rapid changes in technology, domains, and tasks. This is in comparison to the reduction of these engineering and related computer science skills in the United States. Additionally, given the strong demand to have an appropriate balance of technical, business/management, interpersonal (communications,   teams),   it  is   clear   that   academic   changes   are   required everywhere.
In-house testing and training has become a regular and signiﬁcant component in the Indian service ﬁrm hiring process. Companies have also established dedicated facilities for employee skill enhancement initiatives. NASSCOM (National Asso-ciation of Software and Services Companies) has developed a comprehensive skill
Strategic Alignment Maturity	41

assessment  and  certiﬁcation  program  for  entry-level  IT  talent.  It  also  has implemented an image enhancement program to create the awareness of opportu-nities in the ﬁeld of IT. The HR Skills maturity component for Indian Service companies is at an average score of 3.71.
Improvement in the quality of their education system is being actively discussed at the highest level of policy formulation in India. The educational curriculum is being upgraded to international standards at many institutions. When it comes to senior IT professionals or managers, IT service companies are able to manage with either the local experienced IT professionals or returning expatriates, whom IT service companies have found very useful in bridging cultural gaps between local IT professionals and foreign clients.
Partnership:  For  Indian  IT  service  companies’  culture  and  closer customer relationships are keys to competing successfully in providing high-end services. However, immigration rules for obtaining work visas create project planning and management risks. Recognizing these difﬁculties, Indian IT service companies are acquiring consulting ﬁrms in the United States and Europe, and are aggressively hiring hundreds of IT professionals from within the U.S. and Europe.
The irony, of course, is that as global companies from the West are trying to set up less expensive offshore delivery capabilities, the Indian IT service ﬁrms are building front-end consultancy in the West. Major IT service companies such as IBM  Global  Services,  Accenture,  EDS,  and  Ernst  &  Young  are  aggressively expanding their own operations in India because of the considerations discussed above.
Governance: Indian IT service ﬁrms are enjoying minimal regulatory and policy restrictions along with a range of incentives provided by both the state and the central governments. Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) have also helped the growth of IT service ﬁrms across the nation. Some of the major reforms such as rationalization of international taxation policies, mutual trade agreements with partnering countries, and a proactive and positive stance on international free trade are helping IT service ﬁrms to grow. Until the recent Satyam scandal, India had a relatively untarnished reputation.



9   Conclusions

Achieving and sustaining IT-business alignment continues to be a major issue, and is fundamental to successful BPM. Experience shows that no single activity will enable a ﬁrm to attain and sustain alignment. There are no silver bullets. The technology and business environments are too dynamic. The research to derive the business-IT alignment maturity assessment has just begun and the tools and processes are still being reﬁned.
Much work still needs to be done to reﬁne hypotheses around Strategic Align-ment Maturity and to measure its impact on organizations and their ability to execute strategy.
42	J. Luftman

Research conducted over the course of a decade clearly shows that companies are getting better at aligning their business and IT; albeit alignment is still a pervasive and persistent problem. Overall maturity scores have increased from 2.99 in 2000–2003 to 3.17 for 2009–2010. There is evidence that higher levels of alignment have positive effects on company performance regardless of industry type or organization structure. However, results from the assessment of 362 Global 1,000 companies demonstrates that some industries clearly do a better job of aligningtheir IT and business operations than others, Additional studies have linked high alignment maturity levels with better company performance measures, includ-ing sales, productivity, ROI, ROA, ROE, and NPM. The research also indicates that there are differences by region. This suggests that the strategic alignment of a company may depend both on industry norms as well as local factors.
Achieving signiﬁcantly higher levels of IT-business alignment across a wider range of organizations is a long-term journey. The journey in each organization begins with a complete assessment of how business views IT, and how IT views business. The journey continues with how business and IT executives work together to close the gaps and improve the performance of the organization. And in the quest for continuous improvement within a dynamic global environment, the journey may never end.



10   Epilogue

This chapter has discussed the concept of Strategic Alignment Maturity as a critical enabler to an organization’s ability to execute its strategic objectives and has explored the concepts of a model that can be used to assess alignment maturity for any organization. We have also explored the concept of strategic alignment as an ongoing process and reviewed a series of activities that organizations should follow in measuring and sustaining business-IT alignment.
It is not a question of whether an organization is aligned or not aligned. It is a question of how to enhance the IT-business relationship to help improve opportu-nities for leveraging IT. The Strategic Alignment Maturity Assessment is a proven vehicle for attaining this objective.











Abstract  There is no shortage of planning activities in organizations today. How-ever, the concept of a process to develop the connections between an organization’s intent and its capabilities to enable that intent is woefully weak and inconsistent in most cases. This chapter strives to outline how an organization can develop a more rigorous statement of strategic intent as the starting point for all investments in change. It delves into what is needed to ensure that the hope expressed in such strategic plans and annual reports is actionable and becomes a reality. It provides a structured and repeatable method to articulate environmental pressures, intent, stakeholder interests, strategy, business processes, and various other capabilities and  the  relationship  among  them  with  integrity.  It  provides  a  process  for establishing the business process architecture of the organization and uses it as the alignment linchpin to provide traceability from choices made in prioritized programs of change in technology, human capability, policy, and other supporting mechanisms back to their raison d’etre: the enterprise strategy.

1   Introduction

This chapter will describe what organizations must do if they wish to see their bold statements of intent and strategic direction realized through the mechanism of business processes. In enterprise after enterprise in all sectors and countries there is no shortage of strategic plans and documented statements of positioning. In addition, there is no shortage of human effort and ﬁnancial resources expended on programmes, initiatives and projects for change within many different profes-sional domains. There is a large gap, however, between the performance and behavioural outcomes anticipated and the reality of what sees the light of day.

In my view, the prime role of Business Process Management (BPM) at this enterprise level is to assure that the various developed capabilities are aligned with one another and together they deliver traceable process performance back to the stated strategic goals and objectives of the “Organization-in-Focus” (OIF). The prime role of enterprise level process management, then, is to ensure that capability investment decisions for change and ongoing management of process operations are always in synch with a set of agreed strategic criteria and not to personal preferences of managers. Our processes should act as the coordinator to ensure we optimally allocate scarce resources consistent with delivering enhanced value to the customers of the OIF within the constraints of other stakeholders’ requirements such as regulatory bodies.
The chapter is an update to my book: Business Process Management: Proﬁting from Process (Burlton 2001) that shows a framework for establishing or validating strategic intent in a form that can be leveraged. It will identify means for identifying and resolving potential conﬂicts among various stakeholders’ needs and expecta-tions, products and services and business drivers. It will show how customer relationship lifecycles can be used to ensure we focus on the core value proposition, value chains and value streams against which all other internal efforts and capabil-ities should be assessed. It will deﬁne the processes to manage the relationships with all stakeholders and to support the core value chain to customers, also known as business process governance. It will establish a set of reconciled stakeholder-based criteria to help prioritize and manage changes downstream.
The chapter will consider the role of industry reference frameworks which, along with stakeholder and asset lifecycles, will produce a stable process architec-ture deﬁning ‘what’ the OIF does today and will do in the future. This architecture along with the strategic and stakeholder criteria developed earlier will assure that improvements  in  ‘how’  the  processes  perform  are  prioritized  and  resourced according to traceable strategic drivers resulting in an aligned program of change. It will brieﬂy discuss the performance management aspects of BPM made possible by the process architecture and the stakeholder analysis and how these plus the strategic objectives of the OIF provide the basis for a better scorecard and
human motivation system.
Also, the chapter will brieﬂy introduce the connection to the capability aspects of the enterprise including technology, human competencies and culture, organi-zational design, facilities, equipment and locations, policies and business rules and knowledge sharing.


2   Lost in Translation

2.1	Today’s Reality

By  now,  we  all  know  that  many  grand  ideas  are  never  realized.  Classically somewhere in the range of half of all ideas described in strategic plans never see the light of day and a high proportion of those that do are late or misaligned, thereby

robbing the enterprise of opportunity promised in some form of compelling busi-ness case. These are sad numbers and they have led many organizations to be very wary of strategic planning; sometimes seen as not worth the effort. Consequently, many of these organizations have reverted to disconnected functional and tactical planning instead. These functionally oriented approaches, however, have actually led to value streams and workﬂows full of disconnects and waste. Today, moreover, everything an enterprise does is interconnected and the rippling effect of a change in one domain or department can spill over to many others with severe unintended consequences. We still see plans developed by functional managers that largely disregard their peers’ needs and are blind to the ultimate value proposition to customers. The assumptions made by these domain managers are often self serving due to incentives to be that way. They may optimize their parts while sub optimiz-ing the whole. This should be no surprise since their motivation, as driven by formal accountability mechanisms, encourages localized behaviour.
Functional managers request services and capabilities from enabling parts of the organization such as Information Services and Human Resource departments based on their functional needs and in many cases the functional groups own the budget for change making it difﬁcult to paint a bigger picture from an enterprise capability perspective.  The  resource  allocation  processes  often  drive  support  groups  to become tactical order takers at the expense of their own future credibility. This is how many organizations ended up with 20 or 30 applications and databases all supposedly containing the same but redundant customer information that cannot be consolidated.
In this vein, a number of management styles have proven to be sub optimal:

•   Management by order-taking •   Management by decibel level
•   Management by bullying and ridicule •   Management by hope and slogans
There is a better way than taking an all too prevalent inside-out approach that ignores enterprise strategic intent and customer value creation.


2.2	The Outside-in Perspective: The One That Counts

Customers and consumers do not care at all about our insides. As a matter of fact no external stakeholders do. They only value what they get and how they are treated. There are many approaches to becoming capable that have been in existence for some time that recognize this. Fortunately these are becoming better and better recognized, especially in difﬁcult economic or competitive circumstances.

•   Lean and its predecessors Kaizen and value analysis are completely built around the concept of starting by understanding what the customer values and assessing all activity in order to eliminate “waste” or unnecessary non value added work.
48	R.T. Burlton

•   Michel Porter brought us the concept of Value Chains whereby we evaluated how well all the key aspects of work could be planned to optimize the whole company not just the parts of an enterprise.
•   Kaplan  and  Norton  brought  us  the  powerful  models  of  Value  Proposition (Kaplan  and  Norton  2001)  to  help  organizations  sort  out  the  predominant style, thinking and behaviours they needed to differentiate themselves in the marketplace.

If we take a customer centric approach, then all of these methods just reﬂect the common sense that places the consideration of ‘ends’ before ‘means’. Fortunately we are starting to see organizations take aligned strategy and capability manage-ment more seriously.
•   A BPTrends survey in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011 asked the question ‘What does BPM mean to your organization?’ Approximately 40 % responded that it is ‘A top-down methodology designed to organize, manage and measure the organi-zation based on the organization’s core processes’ (BPTrends 2009).
•   Under the industry leadership of John Zachman, mature levels of Enterprise Architecture have become more than just technology planning for IT organiza-tions (Zachman 2009).
•   Kaplan  and  Norton’s  Balanced  Scorecard,  used  intelligently,  is  becoming adopted as a way of seeing more than just a ﬁnancial perspective on corporate performance (Kaplan and Norton 2006).
•   Compliance programs such as Sarbanes Oxley and Basel II, as well as many others, can be implemented to help cross functional management of value chains as well as meeting compliance regulations.
•   The concept of Customer Relationship Management has the potential to be more than a technology if it starts with customer relationship values and not software as its perspective. Other forms of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) have the same potential.
•   Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) starts with the goal of reusable software assets across a set of enterprise processes.

Our risk is perhaps now having too many choices of potentially competing and confusing cross functional programs that will vie for management attention and lead to a hope that one of these is sufﬁcient and can solve all problems and deliver on the enterprise strategy with traceability of performance and alignment of capa-bilities.  To  stay  connected  to  intent  they  will  all  require  a  common  process perspective and set of artifacts.


2.3	Methodology Implications

With so many pressures and options facing managers an integrative approach seems necessary. Modern methods recognize the need to work at many levels in many domains but also to be connected among them. The BPTrends Associates Pyramid

Fig. 1  The BPTrends Associates Pyramid (Harmon 2014)

conceived by Paul Harmon in Fig. 1 shows an Enterprise level that deals with overall strategic alignment and management of the process asset with governance, prioritization and resource allocation for process transformation. The Process level takes individual processes or activities and scopes, analyzes and designs new ways of working with a healthy dose of project management thrown in. The Implemen-tation level builds the technological, human and infrastructural resources required for the processes to work and intent to be achieved. These can be done indepen-dently but strategic alignment is best served starting at the top and working down selectively within the scope of the architecture.1
The BPTrends Methodology, derived from the Process Renewal Group (PRG) Methodology  is  shown  in  Fig.  2  developed  over a  decade  ago,  it  has  always provided  a   multi-level  approach  that  connects  the   enterprise,  process   and implementation  aspects  of  the  BPTrends  Pyramid  and  adds  the  post  project aspect of governance and continuous improvement.
The Burlton Hexagon shown in Fig. 3 shows that processes are the mechanisms that are measurable and deliver performance through the deﬁnition of the process KPIs in support of the stakeholder relationship and corporate objectives. It also shows that work ﬂows by themselves are not sufﬁcient. The processes must also consider the constraints or empowerment delivered by policies and rules, software technologies, facilities, all aspects of human capital, human motivation and organi-zation design.

At all levels of the pyramid, alignment among the hexagonal components must be established  and  maintained.  In addition, with processes being managed as corporate assets at the enterprise level then traceability of the hexagonal compo-nents to strategic intent is mandatory. Clearly the management of the information asset is also critical since information is created, consumed and updated by business processes.


3   An Integrative Model from Drivers Through Aligned Capability

Figure 4 is essential to align all capability to Strategic Intent. External factors are understood, strategic intent understood and strategy derived including stakeholder value propositions. Processes and other capabilities needs are compared to current capabilities of various sorts, gaps are identiﬁed, aligned and prioritized aligned programs of change established. Cross functional capability enhancement programs and projects are resourced and conducted. Traceability of changes is carefully monitored against strategic intent.
Figure 4’s approach is supported by the ﬁrst three activities in the enterprise phase in the BPTrends Enterprise level work as well as one aspect of the last one: Manage Enterprise Processes.

The chapter will describe in turn the activities and deliverables that the top line of enterprise activity encompasses It will cover:
1. Understand Enterprise Context 2. Model Enterprise Processes
3. Deﬁne Performance Measures 4. Establish Process Governance 5. Align Process Capabilities
6. Manage Enterprise Processes

I will deal with each of this in order with only a brief discussion of the last two (5 and 6) which will be covered elsewhere.
It should be recognized that the activities will naturally build off of one another in a never ending cycle from year to year. The next round of enterprise strategy formulation may be constrained or enhanced by current and planned capabilities from the previous round. If you are fortunate then your new capabilities will be leveragible into new strategic plans that exploit them. Consequently, the activities in the two boxes are signiﬁcantly iterative although, for the sake of explanation, I will show these sequentially.

3.1	Understand Enterprise Context (Methodology 1)

3.1.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of this methodology activity is to understand and validate:

•   The planning horizon for the strategic statements
•   The scope of the enterprise “Organization in Focus” (OIF) •   External and internal business drivers
•   The strategic intent of the OIF •   Organizational principles
•   Known OIF strategies
•   Existing OIF scorecards
•   The strategic criteria for future decision-making in all following process work

It is important to note that, when it comes to the perspective of managing processes as enterprise assets, the work of the architects has a context that is traceable to the intended direction of the OIF. Consequently, the effort conducted at this point is NOT to be confused with actually developing corporate strategy but insteadit is to understand what has been done and be sure that the interpretation of it is a commonly understood and accepted one. Lack of agreement is a warning ﬂag that cannot be ignored since processes have purposes and the analysis of perfor-mance and capability gaps must be assessed against a common set of accepted criteria. If some members of the senior management team see the OIF as being all about customer relationships and others believe that cost reduction and operations

Fig. 5  Object management group’s business motivation model

should be the emphasis then the remainder of the enterprise level BPM work will thrash and stall.


3.1.2	Strategic Concepts

A good starting point and repeatable metamodel for this work has been evolving over the past several years thanks to the work of the Business Rules Group. This work is now published as the Business Motivation Model (BMM) standard (OMG 2009) by the Object Management Group. One only has to look at any number of strategic documents across organizations to ﬁnd that words such as ‘Mission’ and ‘Vision’ become confused. ‘Goals’ and ‘Objectives’ are freely used interchange-ably despite their differences. Even the term ‘Strategy’ itself is inconsistently applied. This problem of lack of precise wording has made it difﬁcult to document statements of direction in any repeatable fashion. It also means that it is difﬁcult to communicate higher statements of intent and approach to lower levels of the enterprise and to ensure traceability of performance tracking from bottom to top.
The BMM shown as Fig. 5, deﬁnes both the structure of the strategic concepts as well  as  the  semantics  of  the  terms  used.  It  not  only  covers  the  traditional
54	R.T. Burlton

components of strategic planning but also includes the concepts of Inﬂuencers (stakeholders in the remainder of the chapter) and Assessments. These will be covered in later sections. An important feature of this model is the perspective offered on its components by Reference Elements. The ones of most interest from the point of view of BPM are Organization and Process. The message is that every level of the organization and also the processes of the organization should have a model with a consistent structure as depicted by the BMM framework.


3.1.3	Scope of the Strategic Models

The BMM implies, as does common sense, that every part of the enterprise from the whole to speciﬁc units should be able to articulate its Mission, Vision, Goals and Objectives as well as other driving motivations. The same is true for each and every process. Of course, the set of organizational and process attributes should also be connected, aligned and traceable among one another.
At the enterprise level a good starting point is to determine the scope of what is being addressed. Once again I will refer to this as the Organization in Focus (OIF). The OIF can be wide or narrow but must be clear. Some choices are:
•   Group of corporations •   Corporation
•   Division
•   Department
•   Internal Group

The advantages of a wider scope are better integrity of overall value creation and customervaluechainbeneﬁts,howevergoingtoobigcanbecometimeconsumingdue to complexity and is almost always political. The advantages of a more narrow scope are easier effort and less political struggles internally, however, sub-optimization is a common risk.

3.1.4	External Assessments

For the strategies of the OIF to have grounding external assessments must be understood by all. These external assessments can be opportunities or threats for us  depending on  our relative  strengths and  weaknesses.  One  of  a number of variations of business environmental analysis approaches is labeled the STEEPL model (Kotter and Schlesinger 1991). The STEEPL components are:

•   Social
•   Technological •   Political
•   Economic
•   Environmental •   Legal
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	55

These are the realities from which we cannot escape. Separately or taken in combination, the enterprise strategy must honestly assess its ability to deal with them or better yet, be able to anticipate a range of external possibilities for them and be ready should they occur. For some, the drivers may represent great opportunities waiting to be exploited for business gain so long as resources are available to take advantage of them. For others, they may be seen as threats to be managed to mitigate risk. The response strategically will depend on whether the enterprise has internal strengths that can help leverage new business opportunity or mitigate the threat. Alternately if there are internal weaknesses it must determine how to overcome them to prevent business erosion or lost opportunities.

3.1.5	Strategic Analysis of External Assessments

There are a number of ways, described below, to discover strategies to deal with the opportunities and threats posed by the external drivers. A few of these are Business Scenario Analysis, Value Proposition, and the Balanced Scorecard. All have their strengths and are more powerful when used in conjunction based on a common process architecture framework.


Business Scenario Analysis

Responding to threats and opportunities as they happen is required but risky. Many organizations are trying to mitigate this as well as build more agile capabilities by using Business Scenario Analysis (Schwartz 1991) techniques originally developed by Shell Oil in the sixties. This approach assumes that no set of drivers is totally predictablesoarangeofpossibilitiesshouldbeconsidered frompessimisticthrough optimistic and assembled into possible scenarios. These are then used to test pro-posalsforsolutionsanddesignfordifferingpossibilitiesunder‘what-if’situations.It emphasizes the planning elements (drivers) that have highest impacts and greatest uncertainty.Althoughtherewillbearangeforeachelementsomewillbemorelikely than others. Some will be inevitable, some strongly possibilities and other just possibilities.


Value Proposition

A key component that subtly but strongly will drive the strategy and also the management of processes is the determination of the Value Proposition. Kaplan and Norton have stated that “The Core of any business strategy is the customer value proposition, which describes the unique mix of product and service attributes that a company offers. It deﬁnes how the organization will differentiate itself from competitors to attract, retain and deepen relationships with targeted customers.
56	R.T. Burlton

The  Value  proposition  is  crucial  because  it  helps  an  organization  connect  its internal processes to improved outcomes with its customers” (Kaplan and Norton 2001).
The Value Proposition observes that no organization can be best at everything and that although it must be competent in all things it has to lead with one of:

•   Operational Excellence
Customers value the efﬁciency and reliability of what the organization provides. Utility companies would fall into this category for the most part.
•   Customer Intimacy
Customers value the relationship with the organization above anything else. The products and services are secondary and can change based on the trust relation-ship with the organization. Knowledge intensive industries such as personal ﬁnancial advisors would fall into this category for the most part.
•   Product Leadership
Customers value the uniqueness and novelty of the company’s offerings. The company will focus on fast time to market and innovation primarily. Certain innovators such as some fashion or electronics companies would qualify.

Different companies can operate with differing propositions in the same indus-try. Each of them, however, reaches out in different ways of interacting with customers and consumers in the market. Finding the appropriate proposition can be hard and political but the process architecture depends on it and the allocation of resources for capability change demands it.

Balanced Scorecard

Kaplan and Norton also developed the concept of Balanced Scorecard and Strategy Maps as a response to the shortcomings of traditional ﬁnancially oriented and backward looking measurement systems observed in most companies. They arrived at the concept that organizations should also be looking at a quadrant of measures that adds customer measures, process measures and learning and innovation mea-sures to the traditional lagging ones. Over the years I have been using a slightly wider view of the measurement system to ensure alignment among all stakeholders, all processes, and all capabilities and building a traceability line of sight up, and across down the set of organizational units (Atkinson et al. 1997). Sometimes referred to as an “Accountability Scorecard” I and others have found it more suitable than a classic Balanced Scorecard when it comes to ensuring process performance traceability. The traceability line states that poor capability means ineffective or inefﬁcient processes that affect customers and other stakeholder relationships negatively and ultimately poor bottom line performance at the enter-prise  level.  Likewise  strength  at  all  levels  drives  hard  to  match  business performance.
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	57

3.1.6	Documenting the Strategic Intent

Experience has proven that following the structure of the BMM from OMG shown earlier is useful in documenting the OIF’s strategic statements in a form that will help the enterprise level BPM work to be conducted with integrity. Separating ends (vision, goals, objectives) from means (mission, strategies and tactics) crystallizes the articulation of the guides for the establishment of process prioritization and design later.
There are other strategic factors of interest such as principles and values but this set is a great starting point as an irrefutable context for relationship management and process management that follows. The strategy becomes more tangible when we add an analysis of the products and services we currently exchange and we want to exchange in the future with each of our external stakeholders in the next activity.


3.2	Determine Stakeholder Relationships

3.2.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of the stakeholder analysis activity is to understand or determine:

•   Customer segmentation
•   Other external stakeholder types and sub types
•   Today’s  and  tomorrow’s  products,  services  and  information  given  to  and received from each stakeholder type (interactions)
•   The starting point for process architecture development and process analysis •   The health of the current interactions between stakeholders and the OIF
•   Consensus on the types of external relationships
•   The expected needs and expectations (our goals) of the relationships
•   The performance indicators and objectives (goals with KPIs and targets) of the relationship
•   The supporting capabilities required to be successful

Especially useful will be the ends, means and assessments attributes described in the last section for the OIF but applied in a more focused way for each stakeholder relationship.
The ﬁrst questions to be answered regarding external connections are ‘Who cares about us?’ and ‘Who do we care about?’ Some stakeholders interact with us on a regular basis and exchange things with us. Some stakeholders may not interact with us much but certainly affect what we do or are affected by what we do. Others may be interested but are not as close as the ﬁrst two groups. We need to care about all of them and get them to care about us for the right reasons of course. Once we understand them we can decide what we need to do to optimize our part in the ecosystem within which we all participate. It all starts with gaining agreement on the classiﬁcation of the various types of stakeholders that we wish to see. It is
58	R.T. Burlton

important to note that this classiﬁcation most likely will not be identical to the classic  marketing  segmentation  used  for  advertising  or  sales  campaigns.  The segmentation through processes is more based on how we interact with or deal with the various types. For example we may organize and structure sales messaging for selling to the banking marketing segment and the telecommunications market with differentteams. However, the way we do the work and the sales approach itself may not need to differ even if the sales proposal terms themselves do. In this case we would say for the purposes of process management that the stakeholder type is the same at the higher level of composition even if the ads themselves differ. Be careful regarding the stakeholder segmentation names used and the deﬁnitions of them since this can be the source of major semantic, cultural and political disconnection.
The classic starting top levels of stakeholder types prior to decomposition are:

•   Customers and Consumers: those we are in business to serve.
This category is often not as simple as it may seem since there may be many intermediaries or channels to market, many types of products and services for different markets and differences among buyers, inﬂuencers and users.
•   Owners: those who invest in or direct our activity.
This category includes all the investors, boards of directors and senior execu-tives. Again there will likely be sub levels depending on degree of control.
•   Staff:  those  who  work  on  serving  and  supporting  the  enterprise  and  its stakeholders.
Staff is considered to be an external stakeholder type since members are part of the enterprise due to their own free will and will have to be attracted and satisﬁed personally as well as assuming internal roles once hired. There may be several types based on the permanency of their tenure or association with collective bargaining units.
•   Suppliers: those who provide products, services and resources to us. Suppliers may be segmented according to their nature of supply.
•   Community: those who govern, guide or inﬂuence what and how we do what we do.
This can be a very broad category with many segments since those who provide regulatory and compliance requirements and certiﬁcation will be different to those who may be simply inﬂuencers on us or for us.
•   Competitors: those who ﬁght in our markets for our customers.
Competitors may be targets for capacity enhancement through acquisition of them or them of us.
•   Enterprise: the enterprise itself.
This category is somewhat esoteric in that it considers the enterprise to be a different stakeholder than its staff or owners or customers in that its perspective is sustainability and freedom to act in the best interest of its longer term health.
•   Overlaps and Oddballs: those who play conﬂicting roles.
There will always be other types that do not ﬁt the normal sectors. There will also be those that play multiple roles such as customers or suppliers that compete with you or competitors that own part of your company.
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	59

These are all decomposable into sub types but there will be a practical limit to breaking down too far to the point where the further levels are not useful for enterprise level work. Each can also be weighted so that some will be considered more heavily when it comes to inﬂuencing choices and design decisions. The weighting is a strategic choice. You will have to ask yourself the question if the ﬁve customers that make up 75 % of your business volume should be considered the same as the thousands that make up the remainder. Your value proposition should help you since weights will differ among each possible choice. Remember if you do not weight them, you are saying they are all equally strategic and important and you are in fact weighting them.


3.2.2	The Stakeholder Business Context

The Stakeholder Business Context is a model of stakeholder interactions and exchange health. It is represented by drawing a simple diagram of the actual and planned exchanges delivered to and received from each stakeholder type and the “Organization in Focus” We can show all current and future exchanges including:

•   Products delivered or received •   Services provided or received •   Information exchanged
•   Knowledge shared
•   Commitments (formal and informal) made
•   State changes of various assets or relationships

When buildinga context model expect toﬁndthat an incoming item will often be paired with one or more outgoing exchange items. For example a request for credit may come in and a rejection or acceptance may go out in response.
A triage-like assessment of each exchange can be made to get a good start on understanding relationship issues and opportunities. Taken together it becomes obvious which relationships are in good health overall and which need serious attention in terms of the processes that support them or are supported by them. The real value of the exercise lies in the common insights gained across a typically diverse and silo’d group of internal decision makers.


3.2.3	Stakeholder Relationship Analysis

We will need a gauge of current versus future performance gap to discover the capabilities needed and the extent of change. Start with gaining an agreement on the future we want to see with each stakeholder type, determine how to measure the success and progress towards it and then derive the capabilities or critical factors required to close the gaps.
60	R.T. Burlton

3.2.4	Stakeholder Expectations and Goals

A useful technique for sorting out the stakeholder vision is called Time Machine Visioning. In this ‘back to the future’ scenario the architect and strategist imagine themselves going to the future they would like to see at the planning horizon time when all results are in and the OIF is performing as desired. Statements are postulated as to what each stakeholder type would say, or better yet what you want them tosay. It then becomes the OIF’s role todo everything necessaryto make the statements come true. The statements become the voice of the customer and the other stakeholders as well. These are referred to as the stakeholder needs and expectations indeed become our goals for the relationship. The technique deﬁnes value criteria and keeps everyone aimed squarely at the purpose of the initiative but the criteria must be used as the guide to all design decisions. This is not to say that all stakeholders will love what we want for them but since it is our business we must choose. It is also good practice to write the statements as if the stakeholder were actually saying it in real sentences that may start with words such as ‘As a result of the success of the enterprise transformation program, we can now say ...’ James G. Barnes book ‘Secrets of Customer Relationship Management’ (Barnes 2001), offers a set of categories for these statements that can be reused and interpreted in this exercise. This approach applies equally well when examining a single process for its stakeholder goals.



3.2.5	Measurement of Relationship Performance

The stakeholder goal statements are the basis for the determination of the perfor-mance indicators required to be able to monitor success of the relationship and progress towards success. These will now become contributing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) towards the strategic intent ones. They measure value creation from the perspective of the stakeholder as well as the OIF. Both sides must realize value from the relationship to attain its expectations. These will be a combination of effectiveness, efﬁciency, quality, and adaptability. To avoid sub-optimization one KPI will not do. A balance among these will be needed.
The goal statements are also the basis for establishing the relationship objec-tives. That is the target values of the KPIs that the organization will aim for. These will be set for the same timing as the time machine destinations. They may also be established for interim points in time as milestones to be achieved along the way. These KPIs now become part of the Scorecard which in turn will be supported by process measures that will be derived from the process architecture.
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	61

3.2.6	Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and Required Capability for Relationship Success

The gap in current versus target goals and objectives will indicate the state of the relationship  change  required  and  the  extent  of  supporting  capability  changes needed. The size of changes in each Burlton hexagon segment will be greater and more of the segments will be affected when the performance relationship gap is larger. Small performance gaps will not require launching major new systems but a big gap may. Small gaps will not require signiﬁcant organizational changes but large ones may depend on them.
In order to discover the CSFs, make sure you answer the following question: “In order to achieve our vision and improvement targets from where we are today it is absolutely vital that ....”. Obtain three to ﬁve responses from the perspective of each stakeholder type. Consider all aspects of the hexagon as well as dependencies on other processes. The responses should be linked to strategic intent and the stakeholder goals and objectives discovered earlier.
Taken together, the results of the stakeholder analysis will provide additional strategies and criteria for later decision making as well as the beginning of the design of the  process  architecture. There  will be conﬂicts among stakeholder perspectives that will have to be sorted out. This is the time to do it not later in the middle of design, or worse, implementation.


3.3	Consolidate Strategic Criteria

3.3.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of this methodology activity is to:

•   Discover and reconcile inconsistencies and conﬂicts among stakeholder views •   Gain agreement on the decision making criteria to be used to:
–  Assess alternatives and prioritize resource allocation
–  Removepersonalbiasestowardsolutiondesigninlatertransformationactivities

•   Balance the enterprise’s intent with the stakeholder criteria

This activity provides assurance that the process architects will subsequently design  an  architecture  that  truly  helps  the  enterprise  manage  the  capabilities required to attain its corporate objectives with the appropriate value proposition. It will validate the ﬁt among strategic components, contradictory programs and among conﬂicting stakeholder perspectives.
Ideally this will be a simple negotiation that will also summarize the results into a brief OIF and Stakeholder Charter upon which programs of change will be chosen. It also will be the starting point for deﬁning the process architecture that will deﬁne the structure and organization of OIF processes.
62	R.T. Burlton

3.4	Model Enterprise Processes (Methodology 2)

3.4.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of this methodology activity is to determine:

•   All value chains, value streams, business processes and sub processes of value to the enterprise stakeholders
•   The relevance of any published industry process frameworks to the OIF •   The Core Processes of value to the customers of the organization
•   The Guiding and Enabling Processes supporting the Core •   High Level Process Map and Attributes
•   The KPIs of the architected processes

The BPTrends pyramid articulates the levels of process work we can conduct. Our challenge is to optimize process performance at all of these levels. However, the Process Architecture that describes what we do in terms of what’s important to those for whom we do it, starts at the top. Its existence provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts to business process decomposition since it automatically provides context and scope for each. Since the performance scorecard must provide traceability from what everyone does everyday to full process results to stakeholder value to attain-ment of strategic objectives there is no other way to connect these dots. We need integrity delivered by a sound and elegant architecture.
The architecture is built from the perspective of a clear “Organization in Focus” with  deﬁned  boundaries  and  responsibilities.  An  architecture  level  process  is deﬁned by the Business Process Manifesto (Burlton 2012): Now translated into more than 12 languages. ‘An organization’s Business Processes clearly describe the work performed by all resources involved in creating outcomes of value for its customers and other stakeholders.’
It starts with an understanding of the exchanges developed as part of stakeholder analysis conducted earlier. Common sense will tell us that everything coming into the OIF must come from an external stakeholder and be received by at least one process and likewise everything leaving the OIF must go to an external stakeholder and be produced by at least one process. This is the essence of integrity.
The interactions that come from and go to the customers, consumers and main value chain partners will mostly deﬁne our Core Processes. The ones that involve owners, regulatory or inﬂuencing stakeholders will deﬁne our Guiding Processes. Those which send and receive reusable resources such as technologies, people and facilities will establish our Enabling Processes. The typical depiction of these with Guiding at the top, Core in the middle and Enabling at the bottom is shown conceptually in Fig. 6.
A well formed architecture will exhibit a set of processes consistent with well formed naming conventions also as deﬁned by the Business Process Manifesto

(Burlton2012).Theﬁrst ofthese issimply thateachprocess,activity andtask,should be named by an active verb-noun combination. Just as a sentence needs verbs to indicate action or transformation so does a process. In addition, the name should be strong and not employ some non-descript or lazy verb. The process name should unambiguously communicate the intent of the process not its start or some vague action. That means that non–verb structures cannot be tolerated. Gerunds and other noun forms with endings such as ...ing, ...ent, ...tion and ...al must not be used.
‘Marketing’ is not a name for a process. ‘Procurement’ is not a name for a process. ‘Evaluation’ is not a name for a process. ‘Approval’ is not a name for a process. All of these are unclear and in many cases extremely confusing with imprecise starts and stops and a strong association with an organizational function. Unfortunately this vague form of the language is used by many Enterprise Archi-tects who have chosen to name the organization’s capabilities this way rather than using clear process names as the foundation of deﬁning the abilities required. Process names must be crisp, unambiguous and convey commonly understood meanings. This means that, despite what some process modeling academics have shown in their works, the following lazy or vague verbs such as manage, handle, process, and do should be avoided if possible and replaced by something deﬁnitive that is outcome oriented. Rather than say ‘handle order’ say ‘fulﬁll order’ which shows the result of the process. Rather than saying ‘Manage IT’ say Provide IT Capability. Show the process value proposition in its name and do not clump

several processes together under a functional heading. This is not a trivial sugges-tion. Do it and you will thank me later.2


3.4.2	Lifecycle Approach to Building the Architecture

Business Processes move stakeholder relationships through a lifecycle of state changes – from unawareness through termination of the relationship. They also move enterprise assets and other items of interest through a lifecycle of their own – from idea through retirement or termination. There is a time when our customers do not know we exist. There is also a time when they will no longer be customers or potential customers for whatever reason. There is a time when a product has not yet been thought of. There is also a time when it has been retired from service. In between these extremes are a series of state changes that require someone to do something to move them to the next progressive state. These are processes in value streams that we have to make work otherwise potential customers will not be identiﬁed, qualiﬁed or sold to. There are also processes that take product ideas and test them, launch them and sell them. Among the relationship cycles and the asset cycles there may be redundancies. The customer cycle will sell products as will the product cycle. The lifecycle approach is typically easy for staff to articulate one  at  a  time  and  it  avoids  the  normal  problems  of  seeing  processes  within organizational boundaries since it looks at the life of a relationship from the stakeholder  perspective  and  not the  internal  organizational  one.  The  lifecycle approach does not miss much and is easier for subject matter staff to work through methodically and for architects to facilitate.


3.4.3	Reference Frameworks Approach to Building the Architecture

In the past decade we have witnessed the growth of a number of industry and speciﬁc value chain process frameworks or reference models that articulate a set of best practices for viewing and managing the work of organizations. These frame-works serve the purpose of providing a starter kit or a point of comparison for organizations that want a consistent way of evaluating themselves against a bench-mark. Typically organized as a hierarchy of functions, processes and activities with or   without   dependencies   among   them,   they   provide   names,   descriptions,


2 Methodological aspects of how to architect high quality business processes are covered else-where in this handbook. Reijers et al. (2014) present a framework for realizing highquality process models and discusses additional parameters for deriving a well-formed architecture. Koschmider and Oberweis (2014) suggest an approach to design business processes with a recommendation-based editor. This approach can help overcoming productivity barriers and low process model quality by reducing the need for the user to study the modeling notation. Becker et al. (2014) point out that it is not only important to create models which can be readily understood by humans, but also by computers in order to improve decision making on process architectures.
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	65

performance indicators and other attributes that may be reused. These frameworks are not always relevant due to the peculiar nature of the business. They may also use names that clash culturally.  Few  organizations can expect  to simply take  the reference models and apply them without thought or some amount of assessment and modiﬁcation. For process areas that simply require a best practice, these often work well. After all, if you are building capability that will not differentiate you no matter how good you are in it, why would you want to stray from what is proven? Why would you not examine the documented results of work performed by many intelligent professionals who typically would have collaborated over a long period of time to reach consensus and subsequently had the ideas tested in the real world. However, in the areas that you have chosen to be the basis for competition or differentiation, taking on the industry best practice alone will make you the same as the industry at best. Is that ‘best’ good enough for you? If not, you have to develop your own models or variations and then keep quiet about them.


Generic Enterprise Models

There are a number of models intended to describe organizations of all types in all sectors. The best example of these is the original Process Classiﬁcation Framework from The American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC) (APQC 2009). The PCF is very general in nature since it does not try to be industry speciﬁc. It is, however a useful reference in that it is comprehensive, covering not only core processes but also, enabling, guiding and management ones that some other frame-works overlook. It tends, however, to quite functionally-oriented in places where it takes an area such as the ﬁnance function and drills into its activities rather than seeing these as components of other wider processes viewed from an outside-in stakeholder perspective. Nonetheless it is a useful reference but cannot be relied upon alone to replace good enterprise analysis of processes.3


Industry-Speciﬁc Models

There are a number of industry models in place and emerging that aim to describe an industry in whole. The implicit assumption is that every player in the industry is essentially the same as all the others at the basic level. One of these is e-TOM from the Telemangement Forum (TeleManagement Forum 2009) which describes a generic telecommunications organization. In places it is remarkably useful as a process reference, especially in the area of provisioning and similar engineering like processes. Recently APQC has released a set of industry speciﬁc frameworks for certain industries that are more helpful. In all of these be careful of a tendency to


3 Aitken et al. (2014) propose a generic approach to develop organizational models based on process classiﬁcation frameworks such as the APQC framework.
66	R.T. Burlton

be functionally oriented. Nonetheless, many do contain just about everything a company might wish to do if you look hard enough.


Domain-Speciﬁc Models

There are a number of models developed surrounding particular functions within the organization and the processes within them. Some of the best examples of these can be seen in the IT function. Most prevalent is ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) (IT Governance Institute 2009) which is a framework of best practices supporting IT services management. It is particularly strong in the areas of service support and weaker in the general IT management aspects for which one might supplement with other models.Its use is very widespread in the IT community and recognized as best practice. Another model that works well in the IT Domain is COBIT (Control OBjectives for Information and related Technology) which was originally devel-oped as an IT audit framework by the non-proﬁt ISACA organization but is now being recognized more for IT management in general (IT Governance Institute 2009). It is a good partner model for IL especially as the two frameworks start to converge in their latest releases (ISACA 2009).


Process, Lifecycle and Value Chain Models

The longest running framework that takes the perspective of end to end business processes as the point of view would be SCOR (Supply-Chain Operations Refer-ence) (Supply Chain Council 2009). Its purpose is to examine all work in a connected  business  process  chain  from  the  supplier’s  supplier  through  to  the customer’s customer across and within enterprises. In existence for about a decade and supported by over 800 member organizations, it is well respected and highly adopted in companies and industries with signiﬁcant logistics challenges especially across multiple partners. A growing perspective, however, is that supply chains exist in various guises beyond the movement of physical goods and advocates of SCOR will use it for non traditional process customer – supplier challenges.
The  VRM  (Value  Reference  Model)  has  a  wider  perspective  than  SCOR although it also tackles supply chains (Value Chain Group 2009). It has added product development and customer relations perspectives as well and, when taken together, these provide a wide value creation framework more universal than SCOR. These describe the normal process sequences and dependencies in order to take and deliver an order, get a product to market and optimize a customer relationship. They do not cover the general management of the business nor the provisioning of reusable resources. While weak on these guiding and enabling processes, these two are quite robust in their areas of focus.
A government-oriented services framework has been developed by the Govern-ment  of  Canada.  GSRM  (Governments  Strategic  Reference  Model)  takes  the lifecycle  perspective  of  a  generic  government  service  from  concept  through
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	67

decommissioning (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat 2009). Its patterns are intended for use by governments to manage the life of services at each of the stages of maturity.


3.4.4	Architecture Consolidation

Both the process lifecycle and the process frameworks approaches have merit. The combination of them is unbeatable in completeness, richness and relevance. Both approaches tend to delve to a level of detail that is deeper that the single page snapshot that is often seen in the ﬁrst view of process architecture diagrams. Careful layering is needed to ensure that a manageable architecture is derived. A rough guideline of 10–15 core business processes and an equivalent number of guiding and enabling business processes for a total of about 30 should exist at the top layer showing the value chains and value streams has been found to be useful. This mile-wide and inch deep perspective ensures we see the full picture at all levels. Each of these top level processes can be broken into a similar number of sub processes depicted on their own diagram.
Keep inmindthatthestructureandsemanticsofthearchitecture willbe political, there will be a functional bias and it will be confusing for those not exposed to process thinking. Be prepared to make those managers aware before trying to sell the models to them. You are changing the semantics and to some degree the culture of the enterprise as you do this so be patient and give it enough time to steep.


3.5	Deﬁne Performance Measures (Methodology 3)

3.5.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of this methodology activity is to:

•   Identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be used for each business process
•   Associate the process architecture KPIs with the strategic objectives and stake-holder measures
•   Determine traceability of measures across the start to end of the value streams and end to end business processes
•   Identify which measurement data can only be captured in processes later in the value stream that reﬂect those ones earlier such as customer complaints
Measurement  attributes  at  this  level  must  be  consistent  with  or  contribute towards the enterprise scorecard. They will have a vertical perspective connecting business processes to the more strategic measures and a horizontal one connecting to the prior and following processes as well. Both are important.
68	R.T. Burlton

Top Down and Horizontal Perspectives

By now we should have a good start towards the strategic measures of the OIF and the ways to measure stakeholder relationship success. If not we must go back and get this clear or the process architecture level will have no measurement context or criteria. For each business process at the top level of the architecture we determine which processes are relevant in support of the strategic direction of the OIF, which are of value to the stakeholders, and the KPIs for each process in terms of the support for the higher level strategic and stakeholder KPIs. We must also establish the KPIs for each process that can only be captured in a later process if there are any. For example the measures of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the taking of an order may only be measured in a downstream process that receives and settles returned goods from the customer. Effectiveness measures typically fall into this category only becoming apparent later in the value stream. We can also set the targeted performance objectives for the process at this time. Remember that an objective is a KPI with a target level by a deﬁned time.
It is critical to have well-formed KPIs since in many cases the ones proposed are not truly measurable. A well-formed KPI has the following characteristics:
•   Relevant: supports the assessment of a purpose, vision or goal •   Comparable: has a Unit of Measure
•   Time-bound: is associated with a period of time or a point in time
•   Measurable: reliable data can be attained without bias or excessive time and cost •   Trustworthy: people feel conﬁdent that it is accurate
Finding a combination of KPI types is best practice since focusing on one type alone often leads to sub-optimization in the others for the same business process. For example becoming too efﬁcient can affect resource availability and hence service to customers. In addition, the performance of an early process may affect those that follow in a way that diminishes the downstream process’ performance due to questions not asked or inattention to data quality. Once again, four types of measures are efﬁciency, effectiveness, quality and adaptability. Look for one of each for each process and never lose sight of effectiveness.
Efﬁciency and Quality measures are traditional based in more traditional indus-trial engineering disciplines and are typically the easiest to measure since they can be easily counted up, divided and compared at all levels of a process decomposition. Effectivenessmeasuresare thosewhichare associatedwiththevalue received by the business process customer or output recipient. Effectiveness measures are typically harder to measure since they require the receiver’s perception of value to be known. They have their basis in total quality management disciplines such as Lean and consequently measuring effectiveness at lower levels of process decom-position may not be useful if it truly is the whole stream that is important to the receiver.InthesecasesproxiesthatstandinfortheoverallKPImayhavetobefound. Efﬁciency and Effectiveness measures do not question the product or service or capability that is being produced. They assume that these are stable. Adaptability measures  are  those  which  are  associated  with  timing  of  product  and  service
Delivering Business Strategy Through Process Management	69

availability or the ease of capability change. In response to or anticipation of strategic or product changes.
Measurement sounds much easier that it is and means of gathering reliable measurement data are sometimes the biggest issue. Some information may not be affordable or even possible to capture in a timely fashion. Some may be highly suspect in terms of bias and reliability. Sampling theory requires statistical signif-icance. It also questions relevance as to the time the sample is taken. All too often, projecting the sample results to the full population from which the sample is taken will be biased by the time of day or year when the sample is taken. The anthropic principle (Bostrom 2002) tells us that the act of measuring often changes the measurement results due to motivational or physical factors involved in the mea-suring. For example watching staff conduct the work will surely result in different behavior that when no one is around. In considering the KPIs we must consider the feasibility of the means of gathering reliable data in addition to the unit of measure itself.


3.6	Establish Process Governance (Methodology 4)

3.6.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of this methodology activity is to:

•   ensure clear responsibility for all processes
•   establish sustainable process governance and start-to-end management
•   start to deﬁne an organizational migration path to a new way of managing

Process Governance can be  confused  with  process  management  supporting services normally found in a process support group or center of expertise that provides capability and consulting to process projects. That is not what this section will deal with. Other chapters in the book will look at those issues of support and enablement. Here we will discuss the activities required to take responsibility for continually optimizing and managing the process assets of the OIF; its performance and timely improvement. We must answer ‘Who will manage process execution and govern performance and improvement on a sustainable basis and how will this be done?’
There are a number of key roles that must be played in order to assure that processes continue to be effective assets at their best. At this point the reader may have expected a discussion on process ownership. Instead we will discuss a wider set of concepts since ‘ownership’ as a uni-dimensional concept is proving to be too simplistic given that the management and governance aspects of processes are far more complex than that. The term ‘owner’ will not be used here since the emotion and resistance from non-‘owners’ of processes who are day to day managers of staff that work in the process can be too great and often lead to a conﬂict of motivational alignment at the personal manager level. I will articulate a set of roles that are
70	R.T. Burlton

required in order to maintain optimal process performance at multiple levels of value chain, value stream, business process and activity responsibility. As in data management, which abandoned the term ‘owner’ years ago since the data asset is a corporate one and therefore not owned but shared, I will use the term ‘steward’.
In larger mature organizations, speciﬁc process instances will be executed and managed operationally in multiple locations. They will be monitored for perfor-mance and consistently improved across all locations, and along with the total set of all processes, governed for optimization and alignment. This will require a number of roles to be clearly differentiated:
•   A process lead is responsible for ensuring the completion of a speciﬁc process instance for a speciﬁc customer or requestor all the way from the initiating through to the closing event and result delivery.
•   A  process  manager  plans,  directs  and  monitors  deﬁned  sets  of  processes instances and resources and adjusts them to produce expected outputs and business results day to day. Sets of instances may pertain to speciﬁc locations, transactions, projects, clients, accounts, etc. The process leadwill typically line-report to this manager operationally.
•   A process steward is responsible for the designs of a related enterprise business process and its guides and enablers. He or she plans and sponsors their devel-opment and deployment universally. The steward also periodically monitors their performance and assesses their continued ﬁt in light of market conditions and recommends funding of changes. This person will act as project champion for any transformation of the project to deliver change.
•   A process executive governs a logical group of enterprise processes at the value stream or value chain levels of complex and large enterprises. The executive will ultimately be responsible for both performance and change oversight.
Other optional roles are:

•   A governance  coordinator, supports, enables and coaches the stewards and provides executives and stewards with required services.
•   A process management council  brings together stewards and executives for standards setting, coordination, change prioritization and change issue resolu-tion. This council also makes process change prioritization recommendations or decisions

These can be seen graphically in Fig. 7.
Note that these are roles and not positions and the titles may vary from enterprise to enterprise. In large complex organizations they may be assumed by different people. However, in simpler enterprises multiple roles may be assumed by one person. For example, the process steward and process manager will most likely be the same person when the process only runs and is managed in one place as opposed to multiple locations.
To assure overall knowledge sharing, motivation and consistency as well as architecture control and overall synchronization, a process managementcouncilcan be  formed  for  governance  purposes.  It  is  comprised  of  process  stewards  and

3.6.2	Motivation Alignment and Stewardship Support

The deliverables from the ﬁrst three methodology sections must come together and be in complete alignment. Governance without an agreed process architecture means we have no consistency in what we are managing. A business process architecture with no measures for performance paints a nice picture with no ways of assessing results. Governance with measurement and reporting is required in order to have business process accountability for managers, stewards and execu-tives. Conﬂict between the goals of the processes and the personal performance plans of the stewards is a certain recipe for dysfunction at best. Governance will not last long because no one will care about it.
Another challenge is that the process executives and stewards typically need help in becoming effective even at the best of times when their motivation is in synch with the stakeholders receiving value from the business process. These are new and unfamiliar roles that are often overlaid on existing responsibilities and often seen as more work. The BPM Center of Expertise, if experienced enough, can be important contributors in enabling sound process governance.
With the governance model in place it is now possible to prioritize opportunities for process and capability renewal according to process performance and outcomes and manage cross functional change.

3.7	Manage Enterprise Processes (Methodology 6)

Author note: I have jumped over Methodology Activity 5 for the moment since in many cases a comprehensive alignment with other capabilities will take too long and the alignment will be done in a phased manner in synch with the priority processes. I will return to it immediately following this section in Sect. 3.8. This section will discuss one aspect of Methodology 6. Also please note that this section will only deal with the prioritization of changes and not the many other aspects of Managing Enterprise Processes.


3.7.1	Purpose of the Activity

The purpose of this methodology activity is to:

•   Determine which processes are critical to the achievement of Strategic Business Objectives and Stakeholder Value Creation (Highest Gain)
•   Identify the gaps in process performance between current state performance and ideal state target performance (Highest Pain)
•   Find the potentially best choice to improve value according to the strategic criteria created earlier
•   Begin the ranking of processes and related capabilities forfeasibility assessment, business case analysis and renewal
Now that we know the criteria for what is important to the enterprise and its stakeholders and we have a shared understanding of what our end to end business processes are, we can connect up the stakeholder based strategic criteria to give us a ranking of where our biggest return on investment for change will come from.
This will be comprised of an assessment of process strategic value contribution ranking based on each process’ individual Direct Outcomes and process perfor-mance gaps using real performance data or consensus of anecdotal feedback. The best opportunities for raising enterprise performance will be in business processes that have both the highest potential value to stakeholders in support of our strategic intent (the north star of the OIF) and those that also have the largest performance (KPI) gap today from where we need them to be at the end of our planning horizon. In order to do this we can produce a series of matrices and grids of process-value contribution versus potential process-performance gap that are carefully aligned. We may do this in a very formally manner or in a more subjective way if time pressures demand.

3.7.2	Matrix Alignment Approach

The Process/Strategic Intent Matrix

By cross referencing the Strategic Outcomes of the OIF, developed from Stake-holder Outcomes and the OIF’s value proposition to the business processes in the architecture in a matrix we can assess the value that each process should or could provide tothe chosendirection of the enterprise. When summed up and weighted by the relative values (i.e. importance) of each strategic outcome statement, deﬁned earlier, we can identify the level of GAIN the business process can contribute towards the North Star goals and objectives. Figure 8 illustrates how this may be structured. This evaluation uses the OIF stakeholder analysis and strategic intent results.. In the illustration A scale of 1–5 can be applied for each process towards the strategic intent statement and the sum of all scores for each process will allow a ranking scale of most value added process to the strategic intent to least value added.

The Process Performance Gap Matrix

The Process Performance Gap Matrix is similar to the Process/Strategic Intent Matrix in structure. It contains the same process rows but the columns vary since they are assessing performance and capability gaps not strategic contribution. The intersecting cells, obviously, reﬂect a different assessment. This time they reﬂect the potential gaps of the process while holding constant the value or importance of the process in the ﬁrst matrix. The question is one of how well will today’s process design, and its current supporting capabilities, be able to meet the future strategic and stakeholder performance needs? Note that today’s performance and capabilities may not have a large gap but future requirements may mean that current abilities will not keep up with changing requirements and hence a gap is recognized. This is referred to as the level of PAIN as shown in Fig. 9.

Pain and Gain

By assembling the results of the two matrices’ rankings we can map Pain rank versus Gain rank and produce a grid of Highest to Lowest Gain versus Highest to Lowest Pain as depicted in Fig. 10.

Fig. 10  Process/capability migration strategy grid

The processes in the Lowest Gain column represent those that must be done competently  but  do  not  make  much  difference  to  value  creation  if  they  are performed exceptionally well relative to the others so these can be dropped from further analysis right away. The processes in the Lowest Pain row represent those that we perform very well relative to the others so are not really candidates for major transformational changes from a business point of view. The ones remaining in the grid of medium to high in both Pain and Gain are the ones that will give us more bang for the buck.
The Highest Pain/Highest Gain quadrant is clearly where the greatest advantage can be realized and most of the transformation focus and resources should be allocated. Processes here solve the largest performance problems that are most important to the value proposition and intent of the OIF. Lower Gain/Highest Pain processes are not as rewarding enterprise wide and are a second choice. Highest Gain/Lower Pain is better but we must be careful not to fall behind on these and we must remain aware of potential threats and opportunities that change the assess-ment. Lower Gain/Lower Pain may be better served by remaining in continuous improvement mode while we attack the others. The ﬁndings from the grid must still be vetted and adjusted from a cost/beneﬁt, dependency, political and other types of feasibility perspectives to build the transformation plan.
A fast-track version of this grid can be performed using a nine-block triage approach that uses a relative comparison of the processes in the architecture against the enterprise value proposition and company vision, goals and objectives as the Gain perspective. The three Gain categories are whether or not each process is a differentiator towards world class performance (Highest Gain), is a requirement not requiring industry leadership but needing best practice parity or simply a commod-ity process that will never make a big difference no matter how well we make it

perform. The Pain perspective is also triaged into potential performance gap from biggest at the top to smallest at the bottom. Together they provide another way to pick priorities when time does not allow a more structured assessment.


3.7.3	Establish Enterprise Transformation Portfolio

This activity identiﬁes all existing projects of any type currently underway, all planned and funded projects of any type, all planned and unfunded projects of any type and current budgets and commitments-to-complete; maps and assesses the ﬁt of existing and planned projects against priority processes and required enabling capabilities. In addition, this activity determines any constraints that will hinder changes in the priority processes, produces funding criteria for continuation or freezing of existing projects and initiation of new ones, recommends approval or freezing projects; and produces the Enterprise Transformation Portfolio.
The tasks performed during this activity are:

•   Validate Priorities
•   Identify Existing Programs/Projects
•   Rationalize Current with Required Future Initiatives •   Create/Update Enterprise Transformation Program
Detailed methods for this part of the method will be covered elsewhere in this book but if this workis not managed continuously starting with the strategy, process and capability architectural activities described in this chapter then it will quickly revert to a process of ﬁelding and reacting to internal special interests and politi-cally biased misaligned resource allocation.

4   Conclusion

The work described in this chapter is the foundation for managing a modern enterprise; one that is customer-focused, strategically-aligned and process-centric. Customers do not care about our departments, functions or organization chart and should not be exposed to the navigational problems across them. Business strategies are not paper documents to be ignored. They must be used and connected to everything that everyone does every day. Business processes are the only things that connect the dots to create stakeholder value consistent with enterprise strategic intent. This fundamental shift in work towards linked performance management and change management must become a relentless pursuit for change agents. It will happen sooner or later to all organizations that survive. What I have attempted to describe here is a simple and common sense approach to remain true to the ideals of managing by process for stakeholder outcomes not by function for internal reward.












Abstract  In order to be successful, enterprises have to adapt quickly to new opportunities and threats. They have to take smart decisions and execute fast. Innovation and agility become main success factors. The Management of Process Excellence (MPE) is a key enabler. It is a value-driven approach to business process management that can result in dynamic operations of an enterprise. MPE links business strategy with people and technology based execution – at pace with certainty. Technologies such as Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), software-as-a-service (SAAS), cloud-computing or the Web 2.0 support this approach. MPE enables business outcomes through those technology architectures. Knowledge assets such as reference models increase productivity again. The resulting next generation enterprise is ready for long-term success since it can adjust to the volatile business environment. This chapter discusses MPE, an approach to achieve agility and innovation through Business Process Management. It describes the relation between process management and innovation and how next generation process automation can support that effort. Finally, an appropriate process gover-nance approach for MPE is presented.


1   Management of Process Excellence (MPE) Requirements and Approach

The requirements for the Management of Process Excellence (MPE) (Kirchmer 2011a) result from its speciﬁc goals. MPE takes a holistic and value-driven Busi-ness  Process  Management  (BPM)  approach  (Franz  and  Kirchmer  2012a)  and focuses it on achieving two key goals:

•   Innovation •   Agility
Consequently, MPE is closely linked to an organization’s strategy. It transfers business  strategy  into people and  technology  based  execution – at pace  with certainty.  The business  process  is the  critical link  between  both. A company following a traditional BPM approach may launch a process automation initiative to achieve a cost reduction. They are proud of their new automation tool. However, when later on new products have to be launched, the automated processes may not be ﬂexible enough to handle that situation. An organization following an MPE approach would, from the beginning on, drive an automation initiative in a way that leads to a ﬂexible process execution, using people and technologies in a way that allows an easy adaptation to changing requirements, while still achieving the desired cost effects. The company is proud of the business outcomes as well as the new process and its capabilities to adjust it. This ﬂexibility can, for example, be achieved by using a process repository to capture all process-related documentation as basis for the automation or by applying the right process monitoring approaches. The resulting transparency enables the required ﬂexibility.
MPE must achieve two important key outcomes:

•   Enable smart decisions regarding the transfer of strategy into execution – in other words, high- quality decisions made in a timely manner
•   Enable the fast execution of the actions resulting from those decisions

MPE not only does clarify strategic direction, align resources, and increase discipline, as “traditional” BPM approaches do but it also provides quality infor-mation in the required time frame to support the right decisions on all levels of an organization and delivers the infrastructure necessaryto enable the fast execution of resulting tasks, making change easier. MPE can help setting the right focus – on business outcomes and the high impact processes that affect those outcomes most. MPE must enable the desired results at the lowest cost level and combine efﬁciency with quality, reﬂecting management’s desire to get “more for less” (Spanyi 2006). Only the economically feasible approach is relevant in practice. Therefore, MPE requires the use of available standards and best practices wherever possible, based on an approach known as “open BPM” (Kirchmer 2007). This “open” approach leads to high ﬂexibility around the process lifecycle because of the integration of the various process- management phases. This is achieved in a resource-efﬁcient way by establishing an appropriate process management organi-zation and governance to identify and roll out the necessary tool, delivery and transformation standards and guidelines applied through Open BPM. It is all about establishing the right “process of process management”. Examples are methodol-ogies for incremental improvement like Six Sigma or transformation approaches, architecture standards or standards for modeling methods and tools, process auto-
mation engines, or business activity monitoring (BAM) systems. TheMPEapproachisillustratedinFig.1.IthasbeendevelopedbasedonScheer’s

Kirchmer and Scheer 2004; Scheer 1998a, b), a widely used general methodology for business  process  lifecycle  management.  In  addition  to  this  and  other  general approaches (e.g., Kirchmer and Scheer 2004), MPE places explicit focus on innova-tion and agility. Every phase of the process lifecycle has to be aligned with those objectives; other process goals are reﬂected as “sub-objectives”. The entire “process of process management” is organized appropriately (Franz and Kirchmer 2012a). This creates the basis for a high-performance business focused on business outcomes and value-creation – and with that on the customers. MPE underlines BPM’s role of enabler for innovation and agility.
MPE begins with the business process strategy of an organization. The process strategy transfers the overall business strategy into appropriate process structures and its hierarchical decomposition.
First, the main business processes of a company are identiﬁed. Next, innovation potentials and their general process impacts are deﬁned, delivering the basis for the deﬁnition of the business process structure and its hierarchical decomposition and therelatedprocessgoals.Resultareprocessmodelsidentifyingacompany’send-to-end processes. Innovation areas as well as processes and sub-processes that are especially important to achieve competitive advantage are identiﬁed using this processmapwhichislinkedtotherelevantinnovationandagilitygoals,thestrategic imperatives of an organization. The overall goals can be described using concepts suchasthe“balancedscorecard”(KaplanandNorton1996)andthenconnectedwith the process deﬁnition in a “process impact matrix”. This allows to identify the high impact processes a company competes with –about 20–25 % of all processes (Franz and Kirchmer 2012a). The underlying application system architecture is planned accordingly, supporting the required agility. This means ﬂexible application archi-tecture with componentized systems are preferred in “high impact processes” to
82	M. Kirchmer

huge monolithic applications that are difﬁcult to adjust. Commodity processes may still be executed based on standard systems like ERP since a company doesn’t compete with those processes. All aspects combined set the guidelines and strategic directions for a process-centric organization focused on innovation and agility. The guidelines and directions deliver theoverallbasis for all process-related activities in the following phases of MPE. The process strategy provides drives the process governance implemented in the process of process management.
The strategic guideline is passed to the process design phase, where the business processes are speciﬁed in detail. Here, the approach of the “process factory” is used to deﬁne process in form of process models as efﬁciently and effectively as possible to enable the highest agility in the day-to-day process management activities. A process factory is an “industrialized” environment to support the development and the systematic reuse of process and other information models (Kirchmer 2008). Core is an integrated process  model repository that stores  the process-related “knowledge assets” in an easy-to-use format. Thus, a process design can be quickly modiﬁed and used as input in the other phases of the process life cycle. Every process initiative delivers its design results in the repository format so that it can be reused in other initiatives. High impact processes are then optimized and examined for potential process innovation, using appropriate tools and techniques like process simulation, Lean or Six Sigma (Snee and Hoerl 2003; Harmon 2003; George 2003). Commodity processes (about 75–85 %) can be addressed through copying common practices in an industry (Franz and Kirchmer 2012a). An important aspect, espe-cially to address commodity processes, is the use of process reference models as starting points for process design (Fettke and Loos 2007). This reduces design and modelingtime and increases model quality.A process factory is necessary to enable a quick move from strategy to the implementation and execution phase while still having sufﬁcient time to focus on desired process innovations. In the design phase, business processes must be speciﬁed in detailed and consistent descriptions, which can be used to drive the process implementation and execution. In other words, the created knowledge assets must include all relevant information about the processes to be executed to support the close link between strategy and execution. The result is a process blueprint consisting of business process models that form the enter-prise’s process knowledge assets and drive the following phases of the business process life cycle.
Based on these process models, all physical and information-processing activi-ties of a process are implemented within an enterprise and across organizational boundaries. The results are intra- and inter-enterprise processes, ready for execu-tion. The implementation can be carried out based on IT to support the following automated execution or manual execution through people. Generally, it is a mixture of both: automation may deliver the necessary speed and efﬁciency to be agile; manual steps provide the required ﬂexibility and adaptability. Some parts of a process may even need to be executed in teams [e.g., brainstorming activities in a research department (Harmon 2007)] to ensure the appropriate creativity to support innovation activities. This implementation phase includes the software conﬁgura-tion or development, as well as the people change management, consisting of
Management of Process Excellence	83

information, communication, and training (Kirchmer and Scheer 2003). For the implementation phase, it is important to have the process design in a format that enables  a  very  time-efﬁcient  implementation,  so  that  the  execution  can  start quickly. This can be ensured through the aforementioned process factory approach. In this phase, the organization goes through a transformation process to achieve the deﬁned innovation and agility.
During  the  process  execution  phase,  processes  are  executed  based  on  the implemented IT or people resources. The software systems can be standard appli-cation packages, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain man-agement  (SCM),  or  customer  relationship  management  (CRM)  systems,  that primarily support best practice processes. Alternatively, processes can be executed based on more ﬂexible application solutions, such as next-generation business process automation systems, based on a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Soft-ware-as-a-Service or “Cloud computing” bring additional ﬂexibility since you can procure quickly and in a focused way the required functionality. An MPE approach has to ensure that processes identiﬁed in the process strategy as high impact and “innovation candidates” are executed using application systems with the highest ﬂexibility so that they can be easily adjusted to the necessary change. These are processes “built to change”. The people- based execution may be supported by continuous  learning  and  talent  management  initiatives,  for  example,  through computer-based training approaches or regular face-to-face training initiatives. The execution has to deliver the targeted innovation and agility.
The  actual  executed  processes  are  measured  and  controlled  in  the  process monitoring and controlling phase of MPE. In order to do that efﬁciently, systems for Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) and Process Analysis should be used. These software applications can help to acquire relevant information fast and to move quickly from insight to action. If there are negative differences observed betweenthe actual values and theplanned KPIs that were deﬁned based onthe goals identiﬁed in the process strategy, action must be taken. Either a “continuous process improvement” (CPI) is initiated through the process design phase (the design is improved to meet the deﬁned goals and passed on to implementation and then to execution) or the situation is resolved on a strategic level if the business environ-ment has changed signiﬁcantly. Hence, a larger process transformation initiatives may be launched. This phase of MPE overlaps with the execution phase. In this monitoring and controlling phase, process performance improvement methodolo-gies, such as Six Sigma (Snee and Hoerl 2003; Harmon 2003), Lean, or combina-tions of such approaches (George 2003), can be applied to support incremental improvements and ﬁx speciﬁc issues. This phase delivers necessary information about the execution to enable smart decisions based on process KPIs and initiates their execution. It enables a continuous focus on the goals deﬁned in the process strategy and helps measure the business outcomes and success.
An organization can begin a BPM initiative at any of the phases of MPE. Of course, the typical entry point is process strategy, followed by the analysis and design of processes. However, some organizations start with the monitoring and controlling of existing processes, which leads to strategy and process design. The
84	M. Kirchmer

implementation of a process-based software solution can also serve as a starting point. The decision about the MPE starting point should be based on the company-speciﬁc situation: the current issues and budgeted initiatives, the political situation, the stafﬁng situation, and similar aspects.
In many cases, companies select a two-step approach and begin with a pilot project focused on one or two processes. The ﬁrst nucleus of a process organization, for example, in the form of a Center of Excellence is established. Based on the result, theentire MPE approach can be rolledout. Whatever startingpoint ischosen, it is important to envision the entire MPE concept, so every initiative becomes a building block of a successful overall MPE approach.
The design phase, including the process strategy, and the implementation phase comprise the process build-time activities. In this instance, companies created the ability to act fast in order to achieve MPE’s goal of “fast execution.” The process execution, as well as the monitoring and controlling phase, consist of the run-time activities of the process life cycle. They deliver the necessary information to ensure timely and high-quality decisions.
All phases of MPE should be supported by available BPM software, especially modeling software and repositories (as required by the process factory). The data volume to be handled by BPM activities and MPE’s speciﬁc demand for speed and high-quality information make this request even more important. The necessary integration and consistency of process-related knowledge, especially the business process models, cannot be achieved manually.



2   Innovation: Key Target of MPE

To master the continuous changes and new developments of today’s business environment, innovation – especially business process innovation – has become a core focus area for successful organizations. To ensure long-term survival, an enterprise  must  make  innovation  part  of  day-to-day  business.  Only  then,  can enterprises attain desired revenue and proﬁt stability, growth and high performance in general. Consequently, business processes have to be managed in a way to support and drive innovation. MPE makes innovation a key target. But what exactly do processes and innovation have to do with each other? That question has to be clariﬁed to be able to organize MPE appropriately (Kirchmer 2011b).
More and more companies are built on the principles of process innovation. Dell, for example, did not invent the PC. But itdid invent new business processes to bring PCs to market, eliminating unnecessary steps in the supply chain, while offering more ﬂexibility and control to the customer. These processes were Dell’s main differentiator in the competitive marketplace. Process innovation was the basis for starting and growing this company. Amazon.com did not invent the book, but it introduced a now-popular process of buying books online from the comfort of your living room. This is a process innovation based on the Internet with its new technical capabilities. eBay did not invent the auction, but its online, easy-to-use
Management of Process Excellence	85

processes increased the popularity of the auction. This is again a process innovation as the basis for a new business.
Traditional companies are also focusing on process innovation. For example, enterprises in the machinery industries offer more convenient and reliable service processes based on Internet connections to their clients or directly to the delivered equipment.  Airlines  have  simpliﬁed  the  ticketing  process  to  reduce  cost  and increase, or at least stabilize, service levels through online ticketing. This is a process innovation that eventually became the standard, an industry best practice. Banks reduce cost and improve their service levels through online banking.
Business process innovation is clearly of the highest importance for every company. But what is it all about? How do “innovation” and “business processes” really ﬁt together? Innovation is deﬁned as the act of “introducing something new.” A useful structure of innovation is proposed by Davila et al. (2006). According to them, innovation has two major directions:

•   Business model innovation •   Technology innovation

Business model innovation includes a new or modiﬁed value proposition, new business processes (especially in the supply chain), or new target customers and markets. Let us look at a few examples. Levis Strauss & Co. introduced denim jeans. Because of the company’s new process of putting rivets in pants for strength, jeans were introduced as working clothes for farmers and factory workers. Since the ﬁrst introduction of the denim jeans, the company’s value proposition has changed and evolved as denim jeans have become an expensive fashion product. In its PC offerings, Dell’s value proposition was the convenient custom conﬁguration and ordering of products – the supply chain processes eliminated dealer networks and enabled individual conﬁguration by the client, while the target customers remained, more or less, the same as those of competitors. The opening of new markets for existing offerings is another kind of business model innovation. If a company has always sold to the US market, but now decides to also deliver products to Europe, this is a form of business model innovation (new market). Sometimes, the pricing is considered as an additional component of the business model; however, it may also be seen as part of other elements (e.g., aspect of the general value proposition).
Technology innovation has the following levers: offerings, including products and services; process technologies; and enabling technologies. New product tech-nologies (e.g., the introduction of digital cameras) are some of the most obvious forms of innovation. Process technologies support efﬁcient and effective business processes. ERP systems, for example, were able to make speciﬁc processes more efﬁcient and effective. Supporting technologies improve either product or process technologies.  For  example,  the  development  of  efﬁcient  relational  databases supported the development of integrated application software, especially the afore-mentioned ERP systems.
Innovation in the ﬁelds of processes and process technologies show the direct link between “process” and “innovation.” But the other forms of innovation also lead to new processes. New value propositions and expansion into new markets

Fig. 2  Levers of innovation and the relation to processes

require appropriate business processes. A product innovation generally leads to new production or distribution processes. The result is an indirect link between “busi-ness processes” and “innovation.” Basically, any form of innovation requires new or modiﬁed business processes and needs business process innovation: processes with new structures, more accurate, granular or timely data, new organizational responsibilities, new functions or superior process deliverables. MPE supports innovation by encouraging an innovation focus in each phase of the process life cycle: the process management is organized in a way that it makes the changes required by innovation easy, for example, by identifying the innovation areas already in the process strategy, applying the concept of the process factory in the design, using ﬂexible automation architectures like SOA, or measuring processes effectively through BAM.
The levers of innovation are shown in Fig. 2.
But how does an enterprise organize innovation? Once again, the answer is BPM: the management of innovation within an enterprise is a business process in and of itself. This process must be deﬁned, implemented, executed and controlled just like any other business process. It goes through the same process life cycle. The “innovation process” has to be a key process to be managed by MPE.
An example of one such innovation process is shown in Fig. 3. The process develops from the preparation of an innovation initiative, to the “idea ﬁnding” activities, and ﬁnally to the execution of the innovation idea. The innovation manager identiﬁes relevant mega trends and, based on those, the relevant innova-tion ﬁelds. These innovation ﬁelds guide the deﬁnition of the company-speciﬁc innovation focus. This focus directs the “idea ﬁnding”, using internal and external resources.  The  innovation  ideas  are  evaluated,  and  the  most  interesting  ones become  innovation  projects.  These  projects  develop  prototypes  and  business

cases based on the innovation idea. Then, the innovation team can decide which innovation ideas will be brought to market, or the ideas that will actually become innovations.
Owing to the importance of process innovation, the innovation process must support this form of innovation effectively. For many traditional companies, this will require a big shift because they formerly thought of innovation in terms of technology innovation, especially product innovation. This shift can be supported by selecting the appropriate external partners, like universities or research institu-tions, to participate in the innovation process.
When  implementing  and improving  an innovation process, it  is of highest importance to accelerate the time until the innovation can be introduced into the market. This reduces innovation cost and increases the probability of high-revenue effects (George et al. 2005; Johnsonand Suskewicz 2008). An MPE approach has to optimize the innovation process regarding cycle times.
Hammer, the renowned BPM thought leader, recognized that operational inno-vation, or business process innovation, is not easy to achieve. For a successful innovation process, he recommends six key factors (Hammer 2005):
•   Business process focus, from the beginning of an innovation initiative
•   Deﬁnition of process owners, including a senior executive who can make change happen
•   Full-time design team
•   Managerial engagement, ensuring the implementation of the innovation •   Building buy-in
•   Bias for action

Once a process innovation has been implemented, one must recognize that the interrelation with other processes may require additional change. Therefore, one process innovation initiative may immediately trigger the next process change project.
The innovation process can be centralized in an organization or carried out in decentralized units. The more effective approach has to be deﬁned based on a company’s speciﬁc strategy. This is especially true for organizations working in a global business environment an important topic (Bartlett and Ghoshal 2002).
MPE provides a business infrastructure with the ﬂexibility necessary to facilitate innovation, especially business process innovation. It sets the parameters so that an organization is able to react to change efﬁciently and effectively. Process innova-tion is simply a special driver of such change.



3   Information Technology Enabling the Execution of MPE

Most business processes within an organization are at least partially supported by IT. The IT support inﬂuences the management of those processes and can encour-age or hinder innovation and agility. ERP, CRM, SCM, or similar systems are present in one or the other way in almost every enterprise. Some executives are already considering new IT architectures based on SOA or are in the midst of such an implementation. Some companies even take these ideas to the next level, such as those working toward the use of Web 2.0 applications and acquiring “Software-as-a-Service” (SaaS) or through “the Cloud”. But what does it all mean? How do these IT components ﬁt into MPE – or better, why does MPE require their use?
During the last 15–20 years, an increasing number of business processes have been supported by standard software packages, such as ERP, SCM or CRM systems (Kirchmer 1999). The most popular are ERP systems, covering the majority of a company’s operational activities, such as sales, material management, production planning and control, maintenance, asset management, ﬁnance, ﬁnancial control-ling, human resources, etc. The use of standard software has numerous advantages when compared to individually developed software systems.
A key advantage of these “traditional” standard software solutions is that they not only deliver technology to execute a speciﬁc process but also provide best or at least  common  business  practices.  The  software  reﬂects  its  vendor’s  business knowledge regarding a certain topic or industry, as well as the experience of the vendor with other customers in the same area. Hence, the software can deliver common industry practices on which to standardize the 80–85 % of commodity processes of an organization.
The successful use of standard software, such as ERP systems, implies the design and execution of business processes according to the delivered best or common practices of the software solution. If you buy an ERP system, you don’t just purchase a piece of technology; you also buy a set of predeﬁned business processes. In turn, you have to adapt at least part of your organization to the
Management of Process Excellence	89

requirements of the software-based business processes. For example, you may be forced to create some material master data before you send out a procurement order. ERP systems include a process deﬁnition that is more or less coded in the software. The  software  only  allows  very  limited  changes  or  adjustments  of  its  process deﬁnition.  These  adjustments  can  be  done  during  the  software  conﬁguration through the setting of speciﬁc parameters. This is a key task of ERP implementation activities,  together  with  the  people  change  management,  discussed  later.  The conﬁguration of such systems is also more and more simpliﬁed through the use of pre-conﬁgured component and related assets.
Modiﬁcations to the delivered process logic often result in modiﬁcation to software that lead in most cases, to tremendous cost. Many of the advantages of standard software are lost if you decide to modify that software. However, most of the standard systems allow the integration of “add-on software” through predeﬁned interfaces. But this is, in many cases, insufﬁcient, especially for the support of a high impact process that is critical to achieving competitive advantage and that is important for process innovation. As a result, new business processes are not adequately supported by traditional software solutions, which leads to negative impacts on the overall process performance. This is obviously not consistent with an MPE approach.
Key processes tend to be strongly inﬂuenced by a company’s speciﬁc offerings (products or services) and the related customer and channel demands, so standard software applications such as ERP cannot deliver the required best-possible IT support because they reﬂect the needs of wider user communities. SOA and its process orchestration capabilities as well as next generation process automation systems (to be used for speciﬁc processes or as part of an enterprise wide SOA architecture),  so  called  Business  Process  Management  Suits  (BPMS),  offer  a solution for those needs. They enable separation of the business process design and support through appropriate software applications or application components delivered as so-called services (we will use “service” as synonym for an application software component, delivering speciﬁc results needed to support one or several functions of a business process). This means that application software can be used exactlyas required bybusiness processes. SOA and BPMSprovide the environment to link the required application components and exchange data as necessary to support  the  overlying  business  processes  design  (Kirchmer  and  Scheer  2004; Woods  2003;  Kalakota  and  Robinson  2003;  Woods  and  Mattern  2006).  This enables the execution of “next-practice” business processes, that of business pro-cess innovation. In other words, it is IT for business process innovation, as Woods and Mattern, some of the ﬁrst authors of a book about SOA, describe SOA (2006) – a perfect ﬁt to support the goals of innovation and agility of MPE.
The use of SOA can lead to signiﬁcant reductions in IT maintenance costs because expensive program-to-program interfaces of traditional software environ-ments are avoided. All software components are simply linked into the integration environment of the SOA (Woods and Mattern 2006). This resolves many of the issues   of   extending   ERP   systems   through   add-on   applications   supporting enterprise-speciﬁc processes or sub-processes.
90	M. Kirchmer

These integration capabilities are also the basis for the reuse of software com-ponents in the case of custom developments, thus resulting in cost savings. Once a software component or service is developed, it can be used to support several processes. It can be part of another integrated process-oriented software system.
The true value of SOA, however, is only delivered when the environment is used to support business change, to enable agility and process innovation. It can help to build “process to change”. MPE enables this business-driven use of SOA and BPMS by integrating it in the “process factory” and use the process models stored in the  repository to drive the  SOA  conﬁguration.  The  process  design  can be improved and cost and time efﬁciently implemented, through the selection and adjustment of the application components needed to support the speciﬁc processes. New “services” can be added, and others deleted or modiﬁed, according to the requirements of the business processes. These services can mow more and more often be acquired through the internet as “software-as-a-service” (SaaS) or even be hosted  outside  the  organization  in  the  “Cloud”.  These  concepts  are  widely discussed and have great potential although the current use in practice is still limited.
The same procedure can be used to realize completely new or strongly modiﬁed processes, thus enabling business process innovation. SOA can be used to support the fast execution of process designs, reﬂecting strategic directions. Thus, SOA plays a critical role of transferring strategy into execution and operational perfor-mance through MPE.
New IT architectures are clearly driven by the World Wide Web (WWW). The common opinion that the Internet hype would end after the burst of the dot-com bubble in 2001 has been proven wrong. On the contrary, Web capabilities have continuously improved, and the ability to bring people and organizations togetherin communities has become more important than ever (Fingar 2006). The new gener-ation of WWW capabilities is often called “Web 2.0.” Web 2.0 can be perceived as the second generation of Web-based communities and hosted services, which aim to facilitate creativity, collaboration, and the sharing of ideas and data between users. The term was created and promoted in a conference organized by O’Reilly Media in 2004 (O’Reilly 2005).
There are already many current initiatives to transfer the capabilities of Web 2.0 into the business world, targeting enterprise clients. The result is the “Enterprise 2.0” (McAffee 2006). Enterprise 2.0 is a company using the capabilities of Web 2.0 for its business purposes (Kemsley 2014). A large retail chain has for example built and internal web community to collect all the information about the BPM experts across the organization and their capabilities. Employees interested in that topic grow the content accessible and help building BPM assets necessary to keep MPE alive.
The Enterprise 2.0+ is highly integrated with the business environment, as shown in Fig. 4. A company may be member of many online communities. Imagine using an environment like Youtube to exchange business process models. Instead of posting videos, companies could post process models representing their organiza-tion’s best business practices or other interesting process ideas. This could facilitate

the exchange of business experiences within and across speciﬁc industries – which would become an important factor to support MPE’s design of innovative pro-cesses.  Many  organizations  already  use  Facebook  or  Twitter  to  support  their marketing and customer care activities. An airline, for example, provides special services to their frequent ﬂyers who are identiﬁed when they are active in Twitter at the airport.
The Web 2.0 environment could be utilized to make the Enterprise 2.0+ part of a powerful virtual organization. For example, one could create an innovation network aroundthe company, including customers, partners, research institutes, universities, etc. The exchange of ideas could be organized through blogs.
Until now, most information systems received necessary data through human interaction. For example, a person enters the shipping data of orders. This is often very costly and leads to delays. New technologies, such as radio frequency identi-ﬁcation (RFID), enable the automated creation of that data. For example, once containers are loaded into a ship, this information is automatically transferred through RFID into a software system and from there becomes available through the Web. The result is an “intelligent environment” or the “internet of things” (Fleisch et al. 2005; Mattern 2005), which ultimately leads to business processes that enable innovation and high performance.
This intelligent environment closes the gap between the real and the virtual world step by step. Once you have more and more information about the real world digitized, you can start using this information as building blocks for a virtual world,
92	M. Kirchmer

allowing the realistic test of new business process as described above. And, the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds then begin the blur.
The Enterprise 2.0+ is clearly a perfect environment for MPE. It permanently delivers the information necessary for timely decisions and supports the almost real-time execution of the resulting actions. Strategy and its execution are closely integrated.  Agility  and  innovation  are  strongly  encouraged.  Therefore,  MPE requires an early adaptation of the Enterprise 2.0 approach.
A key challenge of Enterprise 2.0+ is ﬁnding the appropriate governance model. Web 2.0 empowers people and encourages creativity. But how do you ensure that they still work toward the company’s goals? A traditional governance model, consisting of many inﬂexible rules and policies, does not work in such an environ-ment. The Enterprise 2.0+ could utilize a governance model similar to that of the online  encyclopedia  Wikipedia.  Users  are  guided  through  common  goals  and control themselves. However, it is clear that an enterprise is more complex, so the governance has to be more reﬁned. But the direction is demonstrated by Web 2.0 communities like Wikipedia.



4   Business Process Governance for MPE

Business process governance (BPG) is a set of guidelines focused on organizing all BPM activities and initiatives of an organization in order to manage all of its business  processes  (Kirchmer  2005;  Kirchmer  and  Spanyi  2007;  Markus  and Jacobson 2014). The core of BPG is the “process of process management” (Franz and Kirchmer 2012a). The resulting governance framework provides the frame of reference to guide organizational units of an enterprise and enable responsibility and accountability for adhering to the BPM approach, thus to follow the MPE philosophy. Therefore, the deﬁnition of appropriate governance and governance bodies is a key element of MPE and a differentiator to other approaches. Scheer and Brabander (2014) suggest an alternative view on business process governance by proposing an “accountability framework”. This view is included in our approach of BPG for MPE.
BPG involves the following components:

•   A high-level model of an organization’s key processes
•   Clariﬁcation of high-level goals to frame the deﬁnition of KPIs that will be used to  monitor  the  performance  of  these  business  processes;  this  includes innovation-related goals
•   Accountability for the innovation, improvement, and management of business processes
•   A clear formal structure for the description of business processes and the related aspects (enterprise or business architecture) to transform processes into assets
•   An outline of the infrastructure necessary for MPE and the related process of process management

Fig. 5  Relation of BPG and business process management

•   Aligned recognition and reward systems
•   The set of priorities in innovating and improving key business processes

The primary objective of BPG is to set the stage for the effective deployment of BPM to create value for customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. BPG ensures that BPM delivers consistent business results to satisfy and exceed the expectations of an organization. BPG is responsible for the management of the BPM process. This means you implement MPE through BPG (Kirchmer 2008; Franz and Kirchmer 2012a). MPE again drives the success of all other business processes, speciﬁcally high impact processes relevant for a company’s competitive positioning. The relation between BPG and BPM is explained in Fig. 5.
BPG is relevant for all phases of MPE: design, implementation, execution, as well as monitoring and controlling of processes. Hence, it includes the entire “BPM delivery”. Each phase of MPE is guided by BPG, leading to its overall orchestra-tion. These guidelines may target the content of process models (e.g., identifying and mitigating risks) or purely formal aspects of BPM (e.g., each function of a process model must be assigned to the responsible and accountable organizational unit) or they deﬁne how decisions around the process are taken.
An example of a BPG guideline for process design is “graphically identify operational risk in process models” “or use Lean and Six Sigma as analysis and design principles.” A process implementation example is “deploying the related business application software (ERP, SCM, CRM, etc.) to support the business
94	M. Kirchmer

processes” (Kirchmer and Scheer 2004) (resulting in a “process-oriented imple-mentation”). “Anychange of the process workﬂow must be approved by the process owners” is an example of a guideline for process execution. “Benchmarks for process KPIs have to be checked and, if necessary, updated every 6 months” guides the CPI in the controlling phase of MPE.
What is the broader background of BPG? BPG is the required foundation to assure the sustainability of process innovation and improvements and the continu-ous focus  on creating value for all  stakeholders, such as customers,  business partners, employees, and shareholders. The importance of governance has already been recognized in one-time improvements to individual business processes, such as  order  to  cash,  source  to  pay  or  new  product  development.  Its  importance increases signiﬁcantly when an organization decides to deploy MPE on an enter-prise level for competitive advantage, hence when MPE becomes a real manage-ment discipline.
BPG enables and guides the enterprise-speciﬁc execution of MPE. It is an essential component of leadership; therefore, general principles for execution of strategies and management tasks must be considered when deﬁning BPG for an organization (Bossidy and Charan 2002):

•   Know your people and your business •   Insist on realism
•   Set clear goals and priorities •   Follow through
•   Reward the doers
•   Expand the capabilities of your employees

To develop BPG for an organization, it is crucial that the leadership team knows the people and the business of an enterprise within the context of key business processes. A focus on realism and achieving a shared understanding of the organi-zation’s business processes are required when developing BPG guidelines; other-wise, the guidelines are worthless. At a minimum, the leadership team must have a common understanding of the high-level business processes, including clarity on organizational responsibilities, deliverables, inputs, outputs, key functional steps, dependencies, and KPIs. Within BPG, clear goals and priorities must be set so that people’s efforts in executing MPE activities are as effective as possible and that appropriate attention is set on innovation and agility. BPG ensures that business performance management activities create value, and the “doers” or people, who get them done, are rewarded. This really makes BPM a part of the how the organization completes work. BPG should include guidelines for training and education to expand the capabilities of employees, and call attention to the impor-tance of cross-functional collaboration to properly equip people involved in BPM. The  leaders  of  organizations  that  chose  to  deploy  MPE  as  a  management discipline  appreciate  that  value  is  created  and  work  is  accomplished  via  the organization’s  business  processes.  They  recognize  the  importance  of  MPE  to topics, such as execution of strategy, growth, and the integration of mergers and acquisitions. These topics typically preoccupy the thoughts of leadership teams –
Management of Process Excellence	95

the people of an organization responsible for making MPE happen – in high-performance businesses.
Thoughtful leaders recognize that MPE enables the clearer formulation and especially execution of strategy. As far back as 1985, Michael Porter emphasized the concept of the value chain and noted, “Activities, then, are the basics of competitive advantage. Overall advantage or disadvantage results from all of a company’s activities, not only a few” and then went on to say, “The essence of strategy is choosing to perform activities differently than rivals do” (Porter 1996). Organizational strategy drives the design of BPG and MPE enables the execution of strategy. This aspect supports MPE’s key role as the link between strategy and operations, which will drive high performance for the organization.
When  it  comes  to sustainable organic growth  and  innovation, leaders  also recognize that MPE is equally important. Rapid, sustainable growth requires a systemic view of the business and broad collaboration, which requires immense effort from many ﬁrms. The design of BPG must recognize that focusing on goals, such as ﬂawless delivery responsiveness, is essential in providing existing products or services to existing or new markets.
When growth is planned through mergers or acquisitions, the integration phase is essential to success. Perceptive leaders appreciate that an important reason for the success of mergers or acquisitions is the ability of the merged ﬁrm to perform for and meet the needs of their customers. It is in the “integration phase” that MPE can play an enabling role. This is related to the fact that merged ﬁrms often have an opportunity to gather speciﬁc information on comparative core business processes and their relative health, and address customer facing issues in the premerger due diligence period. MPE makes M&A initiatives innovation projects, creating a new organization that uses systematically synergies between the merging companies by providing the transparency, for example, though the process repositories used in the process factory.
BPG plays a key role in MPE and enabling high performance for an enterprise. Organizations elect to invest energy in establishing BPG because it is the manage-ment infrastructure that enables them to address critical topics, such as strategy, growth, and the integration of mergers and acquisitions through the improvement and management of the corporation’s core business processes. BPG sets the stage to achieve competitive advantage through MPE. It moves MPE to a consequent support of innovation and agility.
In the previously described concept of the Enterprise 2.0+, BPG must be adapted by focusing on goals and general directions regarding the MPE activities, while still addressing the aforementioned topics. BPG has to offer sufﬁcient freedom – and also sufﬁcient direction – to people to truly use the beneﬁts of Web 2.0 capabilities. Creativity and collaboration need to be applied to achieve the organization’s goals and provide value to the relevant stakeholders.
BPG  is,  in  organizations,  often  organized  through  a  specialized  Center  of Excellence (CoE) who “owns” the process of process management. The CoE delivers process management services to the organizations, provides the necessary standards, and enforces BPG rules and guidelines. The CoE organizes the process

of process management and its roll out. The main aspects to be considered while setting up a CoE are shown in Fig. 6. Rosemann provides a detailed discussion on the service portfolio of BPM centers of excellence (Rosemann 2014), and Jesus et al. show how a center of excellence has been implemented at a Brazilian company (Jesus et al. 2014). The head of the CoE is emerging as a new top management position, a Chief Process Ofﬁcer (Franz and Kirchmer 2012b).
CoE in an MPE environment enforces the consequent realization of agility and innovation. For example, it selects and enforces standards around the process life cycle, supporting the “process factory”, such as an enterprise wide repository, or provides  ﬂexible  process  execution  and  controlling  solutions  to  the  entire organization.
BPG provides to an MPE environment enough freedom to achieve innovation and agility and combines it with sufﬁcient structure to enable the alignment with the overall strategy.  It makes MPE the key link between strategy and operations enabling sustainable high performance.



5   MPE in Practice

During the last years more and more companies have started to move towards an outcome-focused and value-driven approach to BPM.They typically see BPM as an overarching management discipline. MPE has a role in this new thinking happen-ing. Here a couple examples of companies going that way (Franz and Kirchmer 2012a).
A major technology company won a signiﬁcant new contract that allowed them to sell in 5 years ten times more of a speciﬁc product line. While this was good news
Management of Process Excellence	97

for the division head the new situation also created lots of questions and concerns. Are the supply chain and engineering processes able to handle that volume? How do we scale up our processes? Where do we have to invest? What do we have to do in detail?
The company used MPE to answer those questions. In a ﬁrst step MPE provided visibility into the supply chain and engineering processes. This was achieved through a repository based modeling approach – a ﬁrst step towards a process factory. The process models allowed to identify areas for improvement and launch ﬁrst transformation initiatives.
In a second step the company simulated key sub-processes using the existing process models enriched through relevant process attributes, like time and cost values or probabilities. This simulation helped discovering systematically bottle-necks by showing what happens if the company has to handle twice, three times, ﬁve times or ten times more orders. It turned out that some of the already started investment initiatives could be stopped or reduced since the areas had already been improved sufﬁciently in the past. Other processes that were always considered simple and straight forward were identiﬁed as clear issue areas that had to be ﬁxed. MPE helped to revise the investment plan to enable the organization to deliver on their commitments.
The approach was so successful that the organization decided to roll it out across other business units. Starting point for this initiative was a BPM maturity assess-ment. Then they prepared for a MPE CoE to achieve synergies and avoid that every unit re-invents the wheel. This included for example the deﬁnition of the appropri-ate governance and identiﬁcation of company-wide standards for methods and tools. At the end they put a MPE organization in place that helped to take well informed investment decisions and execute quickly and efﬁciently on them. The related transparency helps identifying the right processes and sub-processes for innovation and optimization activities.
A global oil and gas company started their MPE journey to support a major post-merger integration. It was initially the goal just to standardize processes in the new combined organization to make them manageable and avoid compliance issues. Speciﬁc improvement or innovation activities were not planned.
MPE was used to deﬁne the new common processes. Starting point was a comprehensive industry reference model. In joint integration workshops this refer-ence model was adjusted to the speciﬁc needs of the organization. The modeling activities were carried out in a process repository so that the new standards could be published easily across the organization.
This was a very successful start of the MPE initiative. The company was now ready to get even more value out of their process assets. They started to use the process models to drive their safety and compliance management. They added standard operating procedures to their process models and used a simple workﬂow system to move necessary information to the right people. Step by step MPE became  a  powerful  management  discipline  that  helped  to  manage  safety  and compliance.
98	M. Kirchmer

Consequently the company founded a solid CoE to take care of their process of process management and continue to increase the beneﬁts, for example by opti-mizing processes and identifying innovation opportunities. MPE helped to move from strategy to execution, take the right decisions and react in an agile way to business situations like changing legal compliance requirements.
MPE expands a BPM approach through a consistent focus on innovation and agility. It enables smart decisions and a fast execution of the resulting actions. It provides the appropriate insights and move quickly from insight to action. MPE is based on an industrialized management of all phases of a process life cycle in an integrated way that links business strategy with execution through a systematic use of process related assets. The focus of MPE on innovation is paramount since process  innovation  is  of  the  highest  importance  for  most  organizations.  Key enablers are ﬂexible IT systems architectures like SOA including more and more SaaS and Could components. The appropriate governance for MPE delivers enough structure to focus the approach and leaves the necessary freedom for creative knowledge workers.








Abstract  The purpose of business processes is to create value, and the purpose of business  process management  is  to support this  value creation.  However, the concept of value is little understood in BPM, and a number of BPM initiatives have missed the opportunity to demonstrate value creation in practice. In fact, there is little understanding in the BPM discipline concerning how business processes become valuable and what kinds of value may arise from speciﬁc BPM initiatives. This chapter structures the value discussion in BPM by elaborating on the general notion  of  (economic)  value  and  providing  a  frame  of  reference.  Against  this background we review extant contributions on value considerations in BPM and characterize the emerging ﬁeld of value-oriented BPM. As an example, we present the Return on Process Transformation (ROPT) as a measure for evaluating the monetary effects of decisions on process (re-)design.


1   Introduction

Decision-making in BPM is eminently driven by value considerations, even though many of these considerations are not explicated and some may even be processed subconsciously. Such decisions include choosing the right processes with which to support the corporate strategy, which of the alternative process designs to favor, how to improve a given process, and what process solutions are feasible from a technical point of view.
Although value-orientation is an important element for BPM decision-making, a considerable stream of research on value-orientation in BPM emerged only recently

(e.g., vom Brocke 2007; vom Brocke et al. 2010; Buhl et al. 2011). Several notions of value have been adopted in this research stream. Some BPM studies elaborate on value-based BPM (e.g., Gulledge et al. 1997; Bolsinger et al. 2011), while others address value-oriented BPM (e.g., vom Brocke et al. 2010); cultural values (e.g., Schmiedel et al. 2014); value in the quality, time, and cost dimension (e.g., Reijers and Liman Mansar 2005); or value in the ecological, social, and economic dimen-sions (Hailemariam and vom Brocke 2010), and still others relate formally speciﬁed value systems to business processes (Neiger et al. 2009).
Bringing structure to the value discussion in BPM is a central aim of this chapter, since having a clear understanding of the types of value that can arise from business processes is essential in planning, encouraging, and enforcing appropriate organi-zational behavior. Against this background, we provide a general discussion of several notions of value, we position current evaluation methods in BPM within this discussion, and we exemplify how to assess the economic value of process reorga-nizations by means of the Return on Process Transformation (ROPT) measure.
The chapter proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 presents the foundations of the notion of (economic) value by synthesizing selected studies from philosophy and economics. Section 3 reviews current business process evaluation methods based on the value notions adopted by these methods. Section 4 exempliﬁes a value assessment by means of a generic calculation scheme to calculate the ROPT as a ﬁnancial measure of business process reorganizations’ performance. The chapter concludes with a summary of key ﬁndings.



2   Foundations on the Notion of Value

2.1	Value as a Metaphysical Idea

Value is central to human life, as “all deliberate, all planned human conduct, personal and collective, seems to be inﬂuenced, if not controlled, by estimates of value or worth of ends to be obtained” (Dewey 1939, p. 2; emphasis added). To systematically determine the (estimates of) value inherent in a thing through the process of evaluation, it is beneﬁcial to be clear about what value is and when it is achieved.  Common  deﬁnitions  of  value  suggest  two  meanings  of  the  term (cf. Merriam-Webster 2003): (1) value as a “relative worth, utility, or importance” of something as perceived by individuals or groups, and (2) value as a “fair return or equivalent in goods, services, or money for something exchanged” meaning “the monetary worth of something.” But do these deﬁnitions really clarify what value is and when it exists? For example, what is a “fair return,” and when does fairness emerge? Who determines when a return can be considered fair? How does mone-tary worth emerge, and to what does monetary worth relate?
What can be inferred from these representative deﬁnitions is that value means different things to different people. What is perceived as fair by one individual
Value-Orientation in Business Process Management	103

might not be so perceived by another. What has monetary worth in one situation might be worthless in another. The meaning and existence of value is bound to an individual’s or group’s mental states and beliefs. As a consequence, value is elusive and difﬁcult to recognize using the human senses, so value is often referred to as a metaphysical idea (cf. Ramsay 2005). Given the elusive characteristic of value, one wonders whether it is even possible to ﬁnd an answer to the question concerning what value is and when value exists.
A linguistic approach alone–that is, deﬁning the meaning of value and providing a  phenomenological  description  of  the  range  of  its  referents–would  establish features of awareness of value but could not disclose the conditions of the possi-bilities of value (cf. Compton 1958). Another way to approach the question of what value is, is through an ontological analysis. Such an ontological approach would inquire about the being-structure, the being-conditions, that make it possible for value  to  appear  (cf.  Compton  1958).  The  question  “What  is  value?”  is  then reframed to “What is it to be value?”
What follows is a summary of inquiries that have been conducted in an effort to deﬁne an ontology of value, drawing on philosophical and economic thought. The philosophical perspective serves as our main point of departure for identifying essential ontological categories and relationships. We then transfer the philosoph-ical thoughts on the being-conditions of value to the domain of economics in order to answer the question, “What is economic value?” (or “What is economic value to be?”). The section concludes by outlining how the ontology of (economic) value that is outlined in our summary provides insight into the use of the term “value” in a BPM context. In particular, we argue that the language used to describe value in the context of BPM is misleading (cf. Ramsay 2005). For example, we discuss why it is not possible for a business process or business activity to add value (instead of creating value) and why it is not possible for value to ﬂow through a process.



2.2	Being-Conditions of Value

Our ontological argument is a summary of Compton (1958), who synthesizes and contrasts  theoretical  proposals  about  the  being-conditions  of  value.  Compton (1958) makes use of two expressions, value statement expression and evaluation statement expression. Both types of expressions play a vital role in explaining what value is and when value can be said to exist. Moreover, these expressions allow the various notions of value-orientation in BPM to be deﬁned and characterized. (See Sect. 3.)
Compton’s (1958) ontological analysis begins with a linguistic position of the meaning of value, which characterizes value as follows:
1. There  is  a  value  dimension  of  things,  which  is  unique  and  cognitively apprehensible.
104	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

2. The value dimension is unique in its reference to existence, that is, it is generic to its very meaning as an ought-to-be1 (Compton 1958, p. 158).
3. The value dimension of things is diverse, as plural claims-to-be can be distin-guished with each claim competing for allegiance and appreciation.

Based  on  this  characterization  of  value,  Compton  (1958)  formulates  value statement expressions and evaluation statement expressions. Let x stand for any center of value—any entity, single or collective—for which value may be said to arise. Let y represent certain relationships, states, and activities that are of some value for x. Assuming that there are y’s and x’s that qualify, we may say “y is of value for x” or “x ought to be y” (Compton 1958, p. 158). We term a value assertion of the form “x ought to be y” a value statement. According to Compton (1958), a value statement is thus comprised of three elements: a center of value (i.e., a thing denoted as x), a value claim (the “ought to be” claim), and a characterization of the value claim (i.e., some valued quality of x, denoted as y). For instance, the business process “goods received” (center of value x) ought to meet a throughput time of 10 min (valued quality y).
For the purpose of this paper, we expand the set of possible value claims in a value statement beyond the “ought to be” type in order to account for different intensities and levels of a value statement’s normative forces. In particular, we distinguish between “could be,” “should be,” and “ought to be” value claims (Table 1).
We consider a “could be” value claim as the weakest of all value claims, one that exhibits no normative force. A “could be” denotes a mere possibility, the potential of some x to transition to a state y that is of value for x. A potential state y is of value for x simply because it signiﬁes a technically feasible state of x at some point in the future. For example, when one is planning or implementing a new business process x, a value statement that only values the technical feasibility of x can be expressed as “process ABC could be as deﬁned by our process model.” Such a value statement is then satisﬁed by all technically feasible process solutions that are implemented according to an existing process deﬁnition.
The next-strongest value claim is a “should be” value claim. A “should be” denotes an objective, such as an objective in the form of advice or a suggestion. Unlike a “could be” value claim, a “should be” has a normative force, so a “should be” claim provides direction and gives meaning to “could be” states in x. “Should be” value claims can be formalized by means of objective functions. An exemplary “should be” value statement can be expressed as “the potentially feasible business process ABC (i.e., a process that could be) should be designed and implemented so as to maximize proﬁt”; an alternative value statement is that it “should be designed to maximize revenue or to minimize environmental harm,” which would result in signiﬁcantly different directions for respective BPM initiatives.



1 When formulating a value assertion, the uniquely valuational element in what is asserted is that something ought to exist (Compton 1958).

Description
Denotes the possibility of some value center x to acquire a state y at some point in the future, so the value of y for x lies in the feasibility of x to transition to some y. The normative force of “could be” reduces to make y possible for x
Denotes advice or a suggestion. The advice can be formalized through objective functions. “Should be” value claims give meaning to “could be” value claims. For example, a process that could be in a particular way should or should not necessarily be
so. From all “could be” states y  ∈  Y, a process should transi-tion only to “should be” states y 0   ∈  Y 0, Y 0   Y because these states fulﬁll a particular objective, so they are more desirable in a given situation than the “could be” states y 2= Y 0
Denotes a consensus achieved for balancing a set of “should be” value claims. This consensus implies that some state y is col-lectively asserted to be the right state for x to be



From our set of proposed value claims, we conceive an “ought to be” as the strongest value claim. The normative force of an “ought to be” is greater than that of a “should be” claim, as an “ought to be” expresses that something is the right thing to do. An “ought to be” claim has an ethical stance to it and can be best interpreted as a value claim that represents a consensus among a group of individuals about a collectively desired state y  for a value center x. Therefore, as opposed to the singular advice or suggestion implied by a “should be” we hold that an “ought to be” denotes some consensus achieved over multiple “should be” value claims. For example, a process manager could state that “a business process ABC ought to be implemented so as to maximize proﬁts,” which presumes a consensus that balances a set of competing “should be” value claims, such as that a business process should be altogether proﬁtable, environmentally sustainable, and strongly supported by the members of an organization.
Deﬁnition 1 provides a generic structure of a value statement expression:

Def. 1  A value statement expression speciﬁes the being-structures in the world that must hold for value to arise. The elements of a value statement are comprised of a thing x in the world (center of value), a value claim, and a desired state y that is of value for x. The structure of a value statement expression is given by Eq. (1).
fxgcouldshouldought  to  be  fyg	ð1Þ
	

According to Compton (1958), the being-condition of value (i.e., thefact that y is of value for x) is expressed in a value statement’s value claim that denotes a tension between the being of a center of value x as it actually is, and y, what x could/should/ ought to be (cf. Compton 1958, p. 160).
Value claims can be used to express in linguistic terms a value order related to things  in  the  world.  However,  value  claims,  and  thus  value  orders,  exist
106	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

independently of linguistic expressions. But due to their relation to things in the world, value claims and value orders can become an “ingredient” to things in the world (Compton 1958). If a value claim becomes an ingredient to a thing x, that is, if a value claim is satisﬁed, then value arises and is actualized by a thing such that “x is as it could/should/ought to be” (cf. Compton 1958).
The statement “x  is as it could be/should be/ought to be” is an evaluation statement, which signiﬁes a situation in which value emerges from a thing x, since x satisﬁes a value claim. In BPM such statements typically relate to gap analysis, in which an as-is process (or value) is compared to a to-be process (or value).
Def. 2  An evaluation statement expression is used to assert meaningfully and validly that some x is actually of value, that is, it is here and now as it could be/should be/ought to be, wholly or in some respect (cf. Compton 1958). The assertion is valid if its three sub-assertions hold true: ﬁrst, x is in fact, that is, y is now achieved and actual; second,y isstill what x ought to be, that is,the value claim upon x still subsists (e.g., x still ought to be y); and this claim upon x is somehow satisﬁed,  rendering  x  of  positive  value  (Compton  1958).  The  structure  of  an evaluation statement expression is given by Eq. (2).
fxg  is  as  it  couldshouldought  to  be	ð2Þ
	

Value statements and evaluation statements together deﬁne the being-conditions in the world in order for value to arise. A value statement explicates the value claim against some center of value x. An evaluation statement is used to assess the degree to which value is actualized by a thing x.
At this point, the distinction between different types of (strong and weak) value claims and between value statements and evaluation statements might appear to be artiﬁcial—something of a theoretical exercise. However, this distinction is instru-mental to the ability to identify different notions of value-orientation in BPM (Sect. 3). For example, “could be” value claims and associated evaluations are typically employed in structural process analysis, where a process is valued based on some soundness criteria. “Should be” value claims are predominantly used in BPM to assert that a process is valuable according to some economically relevant evaluation criterion. (E.g., a process is operated at a cost minimum, a process creates products of a certain quality, a process does not exceed a particular cycle time.) “Ought to be” value claims are prevalent in the context of value-oriented BPM approaches (Sect. 3), and the process of achieving “ought to be” value claims is an important people- and culture-related aspect of BPM (Schmiedel et al. 2014; vom Brocke et al. 2014).
The preceding discussion sketched the general being-conditions of value of any kind to arise. Next, we turn to the being-conditions for economic value to appear.

2.3	Being-Conditions of Economic Value

The basic assumption to be made about the being-conditions for economic value is the existence of an economic  reality. Whenever individuals engage in making economic decisions, they perceive things in the world as “constituents of a reality divided byand articulatedthrough economicconsiderations” (Zuniga 1998,p.300). These constituents are economic objects, and the world comprised of these eco-nomic objects is economic reality. Economic objects are social phenomena that are the product of beliefs and objective properties of things, “some of which are physical and some of which are social facts” (Zuniga 1998, p. 302).

Building on the work of Menger (1871), Zuniga (1998)proposesalistofconditionsthatapplytoeachcategorysuchthat“thetruthor falsityofabeliefaboutaneconomicobjectcanbeobjectivelysettled”(Zuniga1998, p. 302). For the purpose of this chapter, we focus on the economic value category. Def. 3. explicates the being-conditions for economic value to appear.

Def. 3  Economic value is the perceived signiﬁcance attached to a good2  (its putative features) based on a subjective judgment that considers personal gain (cf. Zuniga 1998). Zuniga (1998, p. 306) provides the speciﬁc being-conditions for economic value to appear:

4. a dependence relation between the assigned importance to any one need or want and the relative importance of other needs or wants,
5. a dependence relation between the relative importance of any need or want and the agent’s overall degree of fullest satisfaction expected,
6. a dependence relation between the importance of higher-order goods (stand in mediate stages toward the satisfaction of a need or want) and the importance of ﬁrst-order goods (provide an immediate satisfaction of a need or want),
7. a dependence relation between the future value of things and the present value of things,
8. the nature of the signiﬁcance attached to a good varies according to the relation between wants and things (i.e. signiﬁcance of a good arises and disappears as wants arise and disappear), and

The value statement and evaluation statement expressions speciﬁed in Eqs. 1 and 2 can be readily applied to make assertions about economic value creation. The fulﬁllment of a value statement of the form “an economic good x could be/should be/ought to be in a particular state y” can be validated through an evaluation statement of “an economic good x is as it could be/should be/ought to be.” The difference between the generic value assertion and an economic value assertion is that the normative force in economic value claims relates to the satisfaction of an economic agent’s needs.
Reference  to  economic  value  is  usually  made  through  the  agency  of  two sub-categories of economic value: the use  value  and the exchange  value  of a thing (e.g., cf. Smith 1776; Ricardo 1821; or Marx 1867). The use value (or value in use) of a thing relates to subjective needs of individuals or groups and the satisfaction of these needs. Following Ricardo (1821) and Smith (1776), the value in use of a good is identical to its utility, with utility being the cause or determinant of value (a “being-condition” in the sense of Def. 3). For example, a machine in a production process has a use value as it is used to produce goods. Likewise, inputs to a production process have use value. In BPM, the use value expresses the utility provided by a process in a given design, considering the degree to which it meets operational requirements. Similarly, use value is considered in design-oriented research  when  methods,  models,  and  tools  designed  for  BPM  are  evaluated (Sonnenberg and vom Brocke 2012).
The exchange value (or value in exchange) of a thing refers to economic value in terms of monetary3 measures. For example, the exchange value of a good lies in its ability to buy other goods, particularly its ability to acquire use value. Because of this transformation potential, exchange value itself becomes a universal value in use, motivating economic actors to increase the value in exchange under their control (cf. Bartsch and Schlagwein 2010, p. 236). A thing can be of value in terms of both categories at the same time; that is, it can be useful and it might have a price. In BPM, for instance, exchange value is apparent in business process redesign (vom Brocke et al. 2009), as investments at a certain exchange value must be made in order to conduct the redesign (and allocated resources compete with alternative investments), and the redesign aims to increase the exchange value of the process. Therefore, proﬁtability analysis investigates the relationship between the exchange value  created  by  a  process  redesign  to  be  achieved  and  the  exchange  value sacriﬁced by investing in the process redesign.
Value-based   management   approaches,  also  known  as  shareholder  value approaches (Rappaport 1986), focus onvalues in exchange, so a thing has economic value if it increases the exchange value (or market value) for an institution that


3 The exchange value of goods or commodities is expressed in terms of a price that denotes a quantity of money asked for a good or commodity in an exchange. More precisely, money is deﬁned as “a universal medium of exchange as well as a commodity for storing exchangeable wealth” (Zuniga 1998, p. 304). The price of an economic good “is merely an objective magnitude of numerical value” (Zuniga 1998, p. 308). The price attached to a commodity is not equivalent to its putative value as an economic good (cf. Zuniga 1998).

owns  that  thing.  An  abstract  value  statement  representative  of  a  value-based management approach could read: “{a thing x} should be {(transformed; used; consumed; designed; controlled; planned; operated;...) so as to (maximize the shareholder value or the market value of an institution owning the thing x)}.”
In contrast to value-based management approaches, value-oriented management approaches  take into account multiple “should be” value claims, so no single objective function can be speciﬁed to formulate a being-condition of economic value. Value claims made under a value-oriented paradigm can be satisﬁed only if sub-ordinate “should be” value claims are satisﬁed and these sub-ordinate value claims are asserted based on a consensus among individuals or groups. In a value-oriented management approach, also known as the stakeholder approach (Freeman 1984), the notion of an “ought to be” is prevalent, and it stipulates that the interests and value statements of multiple stakeholders must be balanced in order to achieve a  sustainable  incentive  contribution  equilibrium  (cf.  Barnard  1938; Cyert and March 1963; Freeman 1984). A value statement in a value-oriented approach could read: “{a thing x} ought to be {(so as to achieve an overall objective) and (the fulﬁllment of the overall objective allows for the fulﬁllment of all sub-ordinate objectives of relevant stakeholders)}.” Value-oriented approaches considerboth use value and exchange values.


2.4	Some Intermediary Conclusions for BPM

From our discussion on the notion of value, we learned that the being-conditions of value are determined by value statements and that the satisfaction of a value statement is validated through evaluation statements. We also learned that value statements’ intensity levels regarding their normative force can differ. While a “could be” value claim has no normative force, an “ought to be” value claim has the strongest normative force as it has an ethical stance. Finally, we distinguished multiple categories of value, a generic value category and the category of economic value,  and further  categorized economic value  as “use  value” and  “exchange value.” A thing can inhere both categories of economic value at the same time, as processes usually do. No matter how value is categorized, the conception and apprehension of value is bound to the mental states and beliefs of individuals and groups, so the existence of value is subjective. Since value is seldom perceptible through human senses, it is often referred to as a metaphysical idea. However, anything in the world can actualize value as long as the thing satisﬁes a value claim related to it.
How, then, can value arise from business processes? The language commonly used in the context of BPM suggests that value is a concrete thing that can be passed from activity to activity, thereby giving the impression that value can “ﬂow” through a value chain or a value stream. In a similar vein, it is often asserted that value can be “provided by an organization” or “delivered to a customer” and that it is an inherent characteristic of a product or service (cf. Ramsay 2005) and that value
110	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

can be “added” by a process or process step. From our discussion on the notion of value, however, we can conclude that such a language may not properly describe how value arises from a process. In fact, this use of language may be misleading and may  encourage  inappropriate  organizational  behavior  (cf.  Ramsay  2005).  We discuss some prominent examples in what follows.
First, value is not an inherent characteristic of a product or service (Ramsay 2005), that is, products and services are not valuable per se. The existence of things is a necessary but by no means sufﬁcient being-condition that value arises in the value dimension of a thing. Instead, the existence of value is contingent on the satisfaction of value statements related to a thing. However, these value statements are made based on beliefs and mental states of individuals or groups. A thing can only inhere value if an individual or group believes that a value statement related to a thing is satisﬁed and that the value claim (that a thing could/should/ought to be) still exists (cf. Compton 1958). Therefore, when people refer to the value of a product, service, or process as such, they may have certain value statements of individuals or groups in mind. Still, for the purpose of deriving management decisions in BPM, it appears necessary to explicate such assumptions so that other people (who likely have other value statements in mind) can understand what is meant by the value of a process in a certain context.
Second, as a metaphysical idea, value has no substance, so it cannot be trans-ferred (passed, provided, delivered). Value cannot ﬂow through a process or an organization, that is, there is no such thing as a “value stream.” Ramsay (2005, pp. 549–550) points out that “it is impossible for a metaphysical idea to move along a chain within a company, far less between ﬁrms and their customers.” In fact, in BPM it is the work that ﬂows according to a chain of activities, each of them contributing to the value of a process (regarding certain value statements). It may look like a value ﬂow, but in order to manage value creation, we must understand that it is not value that is ﬂowing but each activity contributing to the satisfaction of a speciﬁc value statement.
Third, since value is not an intrinsic characteristic of a thing but bound to subjective beliefs and value statements, it cannot be added to a product or service. From an ontological perspective it is not possible that a value chain can exist. Rather, it is a chain of activities that has been planned in order to satisfy value statements that are relevant to a business area. This difference is important because only then does a BPM initiative begin to question the value statements that are implied by a process design.
These considerations have serious consequences for reference modeling (vom Brocke 2007), for instance, since reference models intend to describe (best) prac-tices to be applied in classes of applications (such as sectors or functions). As to the normative power of reference models, it is important to explicate the value state-ments for which these reference models are designed. To date, reference models that have been suggested for BPM do not make such clariﬁcations but implicitly assume certain value statements. (See Houy et al. 2014.)
Although it is not possible for a process or activity to add value to a thing, it may be possible in a process to improve the customer’s perceptions of products and
Value-Orientation in Business Process Management	111

services. Therefore, value is not added to something but is a value perception (of something) increased by a certain driver that is worth specifying. In particular, while value itself cannot ﬂow through a process, value can be stimulated, prompted, inﬂuenced, and created by a process (cf. Ramsay 2005).
A process can create value as resources are used, so processes can be perceived as sequences of resource utilizations (or resource ﬂows). Resource ﬂows may satisfy value statements that relate to a value in use (e.g., the use value of a raw material is instantiated once the material can be used to assemble a product), to value in exchange (e.g., the exchange value of a product is instantiated once it has been exchanged for another economic resource), or to other kinds of value outside the economic value category (e.g., the value of a process executed by an employee is instantiated when the process stimulates job satisfaction).
Coming back to the initial question, value arises from a process when economic resource and business process states (potential or actualized) satisfy one or more value statements that are subject to a particular value claim.



3   A Review of Value Considerations in BPM

Based on the conceptualization of value introduced in Section 2, we now review extant contributions in BPM that include value considerations. We focus on three steam of research: evaluations of formal and structural process characteristics, economic evaluations of processes, and value-oriented BPM. Then we summarize the intermediate ﬁndings from our review.



3.1	Evaluations of Formal and Structural Process Characteristics

In Sect. 2 we discussed how the intensity of value statements’ normative force can differ. Of the three types of value claims (could be/should be/ought to be), only the “could be” type is seen as having no normative force. The value asserted by a “could be” value claim lies in its bearing on a thing x that some state y can be actualized in x.
“Could be” value claims in BPM relate to structural characteristics of a process. For example, in a process design phase it is useful to know whether a process design is feasible, that is, whether a process could be according to some formal correctness criteria. It is also useful to know about the possible “could be” states of a process in order  to determine,  for example,  whether  a  process  is free  of  deadlocks. An important inﬂuence on the “could be” value derives from the technological frame of the process, since these frames largely determine what “could be done” in a process  design.  The  business  process  reengineering  literature  has  presented  a
112	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

number of examples on the enabling role of information technology in process design (Hammer 2014).
In light of “could be” value claims, value arises for a process if the process fulﬁlls a minimum set of correctness criteria.4 Evaluation statements concerning the correctness of a process or process model are typically of the form “a process model for a process ABC is {syntactically correct; free of deadlocks; otherwise sound; complex; coherent; modular;...} such that the process ABC could be.”
Many studies in the BPM ﬁeld are concerned with various notions of process correctness and evaluations of structural process characteristics. For example, van Dongen et al. (2006) proposes structural patterns for process soundness, van der Aalst (1993) discusses algorithms for sate space analysis and reachability graphs based on a formal process description, and Vanderfeesten et al. (2007) propose metrics for describing process models in terms of size, complexity, coupling, cohesion, and modularity.
It can be argued that correctness criteria for processes do have a normative force, so value statements have to be in the form of “a process should be correct.” While this normative force can be assumed to be present outside an economic reality, within an economic reality there is no reason that a process should be correct since no  economic  value  would arise  from the  correctness  of a process alone.  For example, it is not valid to asserted that a sound process has signiﬁcance in satisfying the needs of economic actors. Fulﬁllments of correctness criteria, that is, fulﬁll-ments of “could be” claims, are not sufﬁcient for economic value to arise. There-fore, even if a process designer arrives at a sound process design, the designer may not be able to argue from the correctness criteria alone why a process should be the way it has been designed; a process designer may only assert that the process could be as designed. There may be sound processes that satisfy no economic value statements at all; such processes would be very sound in doing the wrong thing.
Figure 1 exempliﬁes the meaning of “could be” value claims by showing three process variants that have been speciﬁed as petri nets (Petri 1962). Out of these variants, only processes b) and c) could possibly be, since process a) would run into a deadlock (after the transition sequence <T1, T2, T4, T3>). Whileprocesses b) and c) are free from deadlocks, a structural process analysis could not disclose or suggest which one of the feasible process variants should be considered for imple-mentation or execution. However, both processes b) and c) have already actualized value (by fulﬁlling a correctness criterion) since they both qualify for implementa-tion or execution. In choosing a process variant that can potentially instantiate economic value, one must subject the processes to “should be” value claims. The example is extended in subsequent sections to demonstrate that decisions about a process design particularly include accounts of statements pertinent to the eco-nomic value attributed to a process variant.

3.2	Economic Evaluation of Processes

Whenever a business process is to be redesigned or improved, the resulting to-be process is not primarilyvalued because ofits correctness but because of its abilityto actualize economic value or to actualize a higher economic value than a current as-is process can. Not surprisingly, the prevalent and most commonly applied type of value claim within BPM decisions is of the “should be” type. “Should be” value claims imply a normative force that directs BPM decisions toward creating eco-nomic value. Therefore, a typical value statement in BPM may read: “a business processes ABC should be planned, designed, and controlled so as to create eco-nomic value.”
114	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

In BPM value claims about economic value refer to both economic value in use and value in exchange, while value statements in BPM predominantly focus on a process’s use value on an operational level along the dimensions of time, quality, ﬂexibility (Reijers and Liman Mansar 2005), and costs, with costs belonging to the exchange value category. Key measures of process evaluations on an operational level are ﬂow times, ﬂow rates, and inventories (cf. Anupindi et al. 2011). Quality control approaches like total quality management (TQM) (Sinclair and Zairi 1995) and Six Sigma (Conger 2014) evaluate processes with regard to their variability and disposition of risk, that is, their tendency to deviate from “normal” process ﬂows or their tendency to deviate from desired performance levels, respectively. Processes actualize  value  in  a  quality  dimension  if,  for  example,  they  are  subject  to  a minimum number of errors or if the number of errors falls within a deﬁned range. There is no single value statement that determines when economic value arises from a business process. The actualization of a process’s economic value depends on  what  an  economic  actor  considers  important  and  signiﬁcant  regarding  the satisfaction of an economic actor’s needs in a particular situation. (See the discus-sion on the being-conditions of economic value explicated in Def. 3) Figure 2 provides an example, by means of the “could be” processes b) and c) from Fig. 1, of how “should be” value claims compete against each other. The decision about which process should be implemented depends on what state or characteristic is considered to be of value in the situation shown. In Fig. 2, value statements relate to process ﬂow times and process quality. If fast process ﬂow times are valued, then process b) should be chosen over c). However, process c) is assumed to have a quality control mechanism in place, so this process should be chosen if quality is
valued over short process ﬂow times.
This example shows that there is no single, optimal way a process should be designed because value means different things to different individuals, groups, and organizations, and depending on the being-structure in an economic reality, differ-ent kinds of value may arise in different situations for the same process. Therefore, from an ontological perspective, there is no such thing as an optimal business process, and business process optimization is simply not possible.5
Typically, the actualization of a process’s economic value requires tradeoffs to be accepted between or among value claims. (See Reijers and Liman Mansar 2005, who discussed several tradeoffs along the value claims related to time, cost, quality, and ﬂexibility that are pertinent to particular business process design patterns.) For example, a process that produces quality products might have long cycle times and relatively high costs, whereas a process with low cycle times might have moderate costs and a low quality level.
Anticipating and explicating acceptable tradeoffs between or among multiple (competing) value statements relating to a business process is supported by goal-oriented business process modeling approaches (e.g., Kueng and Kawalek 1997;


5 In our terminology it could not be that a process is optimal regarding its ability to instantiate economic value.

Neiger et al. 2009; Nurcan et al. 2005; Soffer and Wand 2005). The idea behind goal-oriented process modeling is to associate value statements (expressed as goals) with elements of a process (model). Like process elements, the value statements (goals) can be connected with each other in order to denote hierarchical, cause and effect, or means-end relationships. With goals mapped onto processes and process elements, the process variant can be analyzed regarding its consistency and the tradeoffs that have to be accepted if particular goals are valued over other goals of the goal system.
Figure 3 exempliﬁes how value statements can be mapped onto process elements in order to assert how a business process should be in light of multiple (potentially competing) value statements. The process structure is described by means of an event-driven process chain (EPC) (Keller et al. 1992).
Figure  3  shows  that  value  statements,  expressed  as  objectives,  are  not  an intrinsic part of a business process but are used to describe the being-conditions necessary for economic value to arise from a process. In the example, a “payroll

process” is considered valuable if it minimizes administrative costs and the risk of payroll processing errors. In order for the process to satisfy these value statements, it should be designed so its elements (process functions) contribute to maximizing the accuracy of data entries and minimizing the costs its functions incur.6
Being  able  to  map  value  statements  onto  business  processes  and  business process  elements  allows  the  potential  loci  of  economic  value  creation  to  be

identiﬁed systematically. However, such a mapping does not fully reveal how the objectives assigned to a “should be” process translate into a value in exchange.
The value in exchange is usually articulated as an amount of money (a price) to be paid for a thing. A price, as opposed to measures of use value, is a measure that allows the economic value of things to be compared, particularly if the things are different in nature and satisfy different needs. For example, let a bicycle have the same price as some piece of furniture (e.g., a couch). Although these things serve different needs and although their use value may be assessed differently bydifferent individuals, it is fair to assume that both things have the same economic value in exchange; that is, if someone owns a bicycle, he or she could sell it on a market, obtain an amount of money in exchange, and then buy the piece of furniture. Due to the fact that things can be exchanged for other things with possiby different use values, the exchange value of a thing can be regarded as a universal value in use (Bartsch and Schlagwein 2010).
In this sense, a BPM decision-maker may well be convinced that some process has a use value but would also want to know what a business process would be worth in terms of economic value in exchange, that is, the return (in monetary units) from a business process if that process could be sold on a (ﬁctitious) “process market.” Having the information about the exchange value of a business process may allow the ownership of a particular process to be justiﬁed. For example, if a process generates proﬁts (i.e., it has a high value in exchange), then it would be a good advice to take care of that process and maybe to allocate ﬁnancial resources to further improve it. However, if the process is losing money, that is, it has a negative economic value in exchange, then a decision maker might contemplate whether the process should be abandoned in order to acquire other kinds of use value with the ﬁnancial resources that the process would otherwise consume. Also, the decision maker  might  consider  investing  resources  in  order  to  improve  the  process (if possible) so that its economic value in exchange increases.
The general approach to managingorganizations with the objective of increasing their value in exchange (the market value) is known as value-based management, often referred to as the shareholder value approach (Rappaport 1986). In the context of BPM, this management approach is referred to as value-based business process management, signifying that BPM decisions should contribute to increasing an organization’s market value. Value-based BPM (to which the literature also refers as  value-oriented  BPM)  requires  that  the  economic  consequences  of  business processes be expressed in terms of long-term ﬁnancial measures that are calculated based on cash ﬂows (cf. vom Brocke 2007; vom Brocke et al. 2009). Despite the signiﬁcance of value-based performance measures for decision support in organi-zations,  and  despite  the  increased  adoption  of  process-oriented  management approaches,  the  literature  has  proposed  only  a  handful  of  value-based  BPM approaches. We consider Gulledge et al. (1997), vom Brocke (2007); vom Brocke et al. (2009, 2010), Braunwarth et al. (2010), Buhl et al. (2011), vom Brocke and Grob (2011), and Bolsinger et al. (2011) as representative of the state of the art in value-based BPM approaches. We return to the evaluation of processes in terms of
118	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

their value in exchange in Sect. 4, where we present an evaluation approach to calculating the return on process transformation (ROPT).
A main barrier to the adoption of value-based BPM approaches in practice is that relevant process-oriented accounting information is not readily available in many organizations (Sonnenberg and vom Brocke 2014). To facilitate the provision of process-oriented accounting information in organizations, Sonnenberg and vom Brocke (2014) propose a process  accounting  model  (PAM) that is capable of tracing the ﬂow of economic resources along an organization’s business processes. By applying the PAM, process managers can determine where exchange value is created or destroyed in an organization, which processes contribute to increasing the market value of an organization, and which resources are exchanged for other resources (cf. Sonnenberg and vom Brocke 2014). Used in combination with recent developments in process technologies, such as in-memory technology (see Plattner and Krueger 2014), the PAM can provide real-time information on the value creation of business processes (vom Brocke et al. 2013).



3.3	Value-Oriented BPM – Balancing of “Should Be” Value Claims

We have discussed value statements that are concerned with appreciating feasible process alternatives (“could be” value claims) and with the conditions that deter-mine when economic value can arise from a business process (“should be” value claims). We also learned that there can be multiple competing “should be” value claims pertinent to a process, so decision-makers have to accept tradeoffs when deciding how a business process should eventually be.
However, accepting tradeoffs does not imply that all value claims about a process  are balanced, as a particular tradeoff may be acceptable to only one stakeholder of a process, while value statements that are signiﬁcant to other process stakeholders might not be fulﬁlled by such a tradeoff. Thus, a business processes may not be equally supported by all parties involved.
Value-oriented BPM accounts for the fact that organizations—and processes in particular—are cooperative social systems and that people are willing to contribute to such a cooperative system only if they perceive their participation to be person-ally beneﬁcial (cf. Cyert and March 1963). Therefore, organizations should offer incentives to stakeholders in order to “secure efforts necessary to its existence” (Barnard  1938,  p.  142).  In  the  sense  of  our  value  discussion,  incentives  and contributions  represent  (prospective)  fulﬁllments  of  stakeholder-speciﬁc  value statements. For example, an employee might be induced to contribute by attractive work conditions (i.e., a process’s value for an employee arises if the process contributes to establishing attractive work conditions), as the employee’s contribu-tion (e.g., a process output) is valued by the process owner and contributes to the fulﬁllment of the owner’s value statement related to the process output. In order to
Value-Orientation in Business Process Management	119

sustain such a cooperative system in the long-term, stakeholder incentives and contributions  must  be  delicately  balanced  in  a  way  that  the  exchange  of  all stakeholders’ contributions offers all stakeholders the necessary incentives. Such balancing of value statements requires negotiation among stakeholders, which can be   conducted   through   contracting   or   persuasion.   Therefore,   we   propose distinguishing between value-based and value-oriented BPM.
It is the distinctive feature of a value-oriented BPM approach that value state-ments are balanced and traded off based on negotiations between process stake-holders. The resulting balance of values can be said to be socially acceptable— which is not necessarily the case in, for example, a value-based BPM approach that focuses solely on the ﬁnancial perspective—so high-level value claims under a value-oriented BPM paradigm are conceived as having the strongest normative force (Table 1). Instead of asserting that a process should be, a business process’s value is asserted by stating that “a process ought to be.” In BPM this notion has been put forth in the area of Green BPM, where sustainability as a management paradigm has been characterized by (a) balancing the views of all relevant stake-holders (b) over a long-termed planning horizon (Alemayehu and vom Brocke 2010).
In order to achieve a balance between value statements, both cause-and-effect and means-end relationshipsbetweenindividual value statements must beidentiﬁed and weighted in a business process context. Techniques from goal-oriented process modeling (Fig. 3) can be employed for this purpose. Two goal-modeling techniques appeartobeparticularlyusefulinthecontextofvalueorientedBPMapproaches:the value-focused business process engineering approach (Neiger et al. 2009) and the i* goal modeling approach (Yu et al. 2011). There are also less process-oriented approaches that can be adapted for the purpose of balancing value statements in BPM, such as the balanced scorecard proposed by Kaplan and Norton (1992).
Whatever approach is chosen for deﬁning value statement relationships, each resulting value system must account for the organization-speciﬁc context. Different organizations may arrive at different value systems since value means different things to different stakeholders and in different cooperative systems.
Despite the particularities of individual value systems, some basic patterns can be  identiﬁed  that  can  be  considered  in  the  formulation  and  adaptation  of organization-speciﬁc value systems. Figure 4 provides an abstract example of such a value system.
The value perspective that is most frequently referred to in BPM is the opera-tional perspective, which focuses on the key performance measures of time, quality, and costs (Reijers and Liman Mansar 2005). From the operational perspective, a process should be designed to fulﬁll quality, time, and cost objectives.
Under a value-oriented BPM paradigm, however, other perspectives must be considered as well if the needs of all relevant process stakeholders are to be satisﬁed. In addition to satisfying operative results, a business process should satisfy the conditions that secure processes’ ability to operate in the long term. In particular, the interests of employees as members of a cooperative system must be addressed. Processes in this sustaining perspective are valued, for example, if they

positively affect the process culture (Schmiedel et al. 2014). Other kinds of value related to process sustainability can also be considered; for example, the state and society may demand that a process be designed so it leaves a minimal carbon footprint or produces minimal waste of natural resources (cf. vom Brocke and Seidel 2012; Seidel et al. 2012).
The process alternatives that satisfy the “should be” value claims pertinent to the operational and sustaining perspectives have different effects on an organization’s ﬁnancial results. From the ﬁnancial value perspective, relevant stakeholders are interested in the exchange value that arises from particular process alternatives. (See the discussion on value-based BPM in Sect. 3.2.) For example, owners and capital providers expect ﬁnancial returns on their investments, the government expects taxes to be paid, and shareholders expect the organization’s market value to increase. As opposed to the operational perspective, the ﬁnancial perspective requires process evaluations that account for long-term economic effects. The value of a process is assessed not only on short-term operational performance but also on the ﬁnancial effort required to implement and migrate the process, on the effort required to maintain its technical infrastructure, and on its prospective returns.
Eventually, an organization can exist in the long-term only if it is successful in achieving positive ﬁnancial results. Therefore, the balancing of stakeholder value statements should ensure long-term ﬁnancial success (cf. Kaplan and Norton 1992; vom Brocke 2007; vom Brocke and Grob 2011).



3.4	Further Intermediary Conclusions for BPM

Fig. 5  Three types of value statements in value-oriented BPM


A “could be” value claim pertains to evaluations of structural process charac-teristics and asserts that the value of a process lies in its ability to be possible, to be feasible, and to actualize several process states. However, “could be” value exerts no  normative  force,  so  structural  process  analysis  and  evaluations  would  not disclose whether a possible process alternative is of economic value.
The existence of economic value can be asserted by means of “should be” value claims, which are prevalent in process evaluation approaches that focus on the satisfaction of a superordinate objective (e.g., a process should be designed so as to incur minimal processing cost). However, a number of “shouldbe” value claims fail to  be  realized  in  practice  because  of  lack  of  support  from  a  wider  range  of stakeholders.
“Ought to be” value claims consider the need to balance multiple viewpoints on business  processes  and  process  transformations.  These  value  claims  take  into account that there can be different objectives for a process that are signiﬁcant to multiple stakeholders. Therefore, to assert that a “process ought to be” implies that the  multiple  process  objectives  are  balanced  in  order  to  create  an  incentive-contribution equilibrium (cf. Barnard 1938). These value claims are pertinent to what we term a “value-oriented BPM approach.”
In practice, an “ought to be” value claim might not be fully satisﬁed, and the resulting tensions and frictions among process stakeholders have to be resolved. BPM capabilities (Rosemann and vom Brocke 2014), such as a process-friendly culture (Schmiedel et al. 2014), might mitigate the risk of frictions among stake-holders. In light of the difﬁculties inherent in achieving an appropriate balance of value  statements,  we  see  an  “ought  to  be”  process  as  an  ideal  process  that
122	J. vom Brocke and C. Sonnenberg

instantiates value for all of its stakeholders. We refer to such a process as one that has the maximum “support” of all stakeholders.
“Ought  to  be”  value  statements  may  come  with  the  price  of  limiting  the satisfaction level of some “should be” value statements, but the balance of value statements is essential to realizing long-term economic value. In this regard, we perceive  the  negotiation  and  achievement  of  “should  be”  value  claims  in  an organization important predecessors of economic value creation through BPM.
Because of the signiﬁcance of the ﬁnancial perspective in the context of a value-oriented BPM paradigm, we present a method for measuring the return on process transformation (ROPT) in the next section. While the ROPT evaluation method is used to calculate a ﬁnancial-process performance measure, it interfaces with the other value perspectives. For example, the application of the ROPT allows the effort required to establish a desirable degree of process-friendly culture or for inducing employees to participate in process transformations to be explicated in ﬁnancial  terms.  Moreover,  detailed  information  about  the  operational  process behavior is required in order to calculate the ROPT. Finally, relevant types of stakeholder value can be accounted for in the ROPT method by specifying cash ﬂow categories that represent (virtual) ﬁnancial rewards or ﬁnancial penalties that are incurred if stakeholder value statements are satisﬁed or violated to a given degree. For example, if environmental goals are not met, a ﬁnancial penalty can be speciﬁed and considered in the calculations.



4   The Example of the Return on Process Transformation

4.1	Introducing the Return on Process Transformation

In  many  practical  cases,  the  question  arises  concerning  whether  it  is  worth re-organizing or transforming a certain process. In terms of an evaluation statement expression introduced in Sect. 2, the question is whether a transformed process is as it “should be” in ﬁnancial terms or as it “ought to be” in terms of a balanced set of multiple stakeholder value.
We propose a method for evaluating the exchange value of a process in terms of a return on process transformation (ROPT). Although focusing on the ﬁnancial perspective, for two reasons the ROPT represents a value-oriented measure of a process’s value: its calculations require consideration of other value perspectives, and its use is meant to complement further value considerations. In practice often the strategic and qualitative effects of alternative process redesigns are considered ﬁrst, and then the ROPT is calculated in order to put a “price tag” on each alternative so decision-makers can balance both the quantitative and qualitative effects of process redesign.
The basic idea behind the ROPT measure is that a business process transforma-tion is considered beneﬁcial if the investment into the process transformation “pays

off”.7 The beneﬁts of a transformation can be calculated by simply subtracting the cash ﬂows of the as-is process from those of the to-be process, which should yield a cash ﬂow surplus large enough to compensate for the ﬁnancial investment in the process transformation. Figure 6 shows the calculation scheme for determining the ROPT.


7 The ROPT does not report a payoff period but a net present value measure. In fact, payoff periods are  not  a  useful  criterion  for  evaluating  ﬁnancial  investments,  since  an  investment  can  be unproﬁtable even if it has a payoff period. Consider, for example, the case of a long-term (20– 30 years) investment. In the ﬁrst 10 years the investment could generate excess cash ﬂows, so that the investment initially pays off after 10 years. However, then the investment could create only negative cash ﬂows, leading to a negative terminal value. Although it has a payoff period, the investment would still be unproﬁtable.

The beneﬁt resulting from the transformed process is expressed as a positive difference between the TPPOP0  of the new process p0 and the TPPOP of the process in the status quo (process p).
The investment into the process transformation, which represents its price, is the sum of all the payments that are required for the transformation, referred to as Total Payments  of  Process  Transformation  (TPPT). TPPT is typically comprised of payments for investments into the technical process infrastructure (like new infor-mation technology), for the development of process knowledge, or for training employees affected by the new process design.
Long-term economic consequences of the process re-organization should be taken into account in calculating the TPPO and the TPPT, which is why the planning  horizon  for  the  payments  should  span  multiple  time  periods  (e.g., 5 years). By netting the TPPO (TPPOP0  – TPPOP) and the investment in the process transformation (TPPT), one can calculate the total expected payments resulting from the process re-organization.
The sequence of direct payments provides the basis for taking into account additional ﬁnancial consequences, including indirect (derived) payments, such as interest and tax payments. Various standard methods for investment controlling can be used to calculate the derived payments. Instead of using classical methods for capital budgeting, such as the net present value (NPV) or the internal rate of return (IRR), we use Visualization of Financial Implications (VOFI) (Grob 1993) to aggregate and calculate the ﬁnancial consequences of a process transformation.
VOFI is suitable for making the ﬁnancial consequences of a particular invest-ment transparent (Grob 1993) since it discloses how the funding and taxation conditions affect the ﬁnancial performance of an investment. vom Brocke and Grob (2011) show how the transparency feature of VOFI is used to analyze the interdependencies  between  business  process  design  decisions  and  ﬁnancial consequences.
Identifying the TPPO (on level 0 and level 1) can be done on a different levels of detail. On a high level, payments can be roughly estimated by asking decision-makers to specify the top 3–5 cash ﬂow positions that they consider relevant to the as-is and the to-be processes. On a detailed level, however, the TPPO can be identiﬁed  based  on  information  on  process  structures,  which  can  be  obtained from process models (vom Brocke and Grob 2011), and operational process behav-ior, which, in turn, can be obtained by process-oriented accounting information systems (cf. Sonnenberg and vom Brocke 2014).
Identifying the TPPO based on process models necessitates that the process models be annotated with ﬁnancial information, as illustrated in Fig. 7.
Figure 7 shows an exemplary calculation scheme for identifying and calculating payments related to a process design alternative on an activity level. The notation used in Fig. 7 is the BPMN (OMG 2010). Out-payments are calculated based on the use  or  consumption  of  input  objects  and  resources  objects,  respectively.  All

4.2	Calculating the ROPT in a SOA & BPM Case

A medium-sized logistics company uses a web-based enterprise portal to support its business processes.8 In the case at hand, management is considering integrating a route-planning process into this portal. Two route-planning types are distinguished: detailed planning and ad-hoc planning. Prioritization policies have been deﬁned in order to determine the planning type for each delivery order. High-priority delivery orders are subject to detailed planning, but if there is not enough time for detailed planning, ad-hoc planning is applied instead. The drawback of ad-hoc planning, however, is that routes may turn out to be inefﬁcient, and the delivery may not be made in time, leading to contractual penalties, so the truck ﬂeet may not be deployed efﬁciently.
As route-planning has been conducted manually in the past, which is time-consuming, a drastic increase of ad-hoc route plans has been noted, even for high-priority deliveries. By integrating the route-planning process into the enter-prise portal, the company hopes to reduce errors, meet delivery schedules, and increase the efﬁcient allocation of resources. The technical implementation of the solution is to be done on the basis of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) (e.g., Cummins 2014). Prior to the implementation, several design alternatives must be assessed:
1. GlobalRoutePlanning – an IT solution by means of which route plans can be created over an online interface and saved to the company’s database. Using the service requires speciﬁc information, such as delivery orders, truck ﬂeet capac-ity, order prioritization, delivery addresses, and delivery dates. With this solu-tion, the process of route-planning is fully “out-tasked.”
2. GeoDataForLogistics – an in-house solution by which internal routing rules and customer data are enriched by external route information provided by a special geographic map service that is particularly suited to the needs of logistics companies. While this service can substantially reduce the planning effort, it also requires the development of a number of data services (wrappers) in-house.
3. IntelligentRouting – a web service by which fully ﬂedged route plans can be created. This design alternative is similar to GlobalRoutePlanning but is used only for a particular geographic region. As the geographic data of this service is up to date (e.g., providing information on construction sites or blocked roads), the planning quality is likely to be signiﬁcantly improved by this solution.

Fig. 9  Business process diagram for the process “Route planning” (vom Brocke et al. 2009)

The internal route-planning process is modeled by a BPMN process model (see Figure 9). In order to indicate process alternatives and specify the quantity structure of the process, company-speciﬁc notational elements (BPMN artifacts) are inte-grated. (See the explanation of symbols in Fig. 9.) Calculation of payments is done according to the calculation scheme illustrated in Fig. 8. Two resource object types are relevant: organizational unit (“dispatching / scheduling”) and the services to be integrated. The quantity structure that is relevant to the calculation of the use of resources is speciﬁed in the process diagram by means of custom table artifacts.
The design alternatives of the process are considered based on a partial calcu-lation (see vom Brocke et al. 2009) in Fig. 9. Various infrastructure requirements (e.g., purchase and maintenance of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), implementa-tion of interfaces, in-house developments) are needed in order to integrate the services into the process. Deciding in favor of or against a certain service in this example is expected to have a local impact only, as there are no structural or institutional interdependencies with other process elements.
The process diagram illustrates the design alternatives as they are given in a particular case.Selection of a to-be model here is made on the basis of a comparison of the ﬁnancialvalue of alternative process conﬁgurations. The calculation is shown in Fig. 10 and is explained in more detail for the IntelligentRouting alternative process conﬁguration.
As the impact of the design decisions is only local, the calculation of the differences between alternative process conﬁgurations and the status quo can be conducted by means of a partial analysis for determining the direct payments.

Therefore, in order to calculate this difference, the expected additional payments compared to the status quo level (as-is) of each design alternative (to-be) must be determined.
Using the IntelligentRouting service for the route-planning process promises both a higher number of detailed plans that are possible (pDP) and a better quality of realized detailed plans (rDP). It is expected that the processing time (PT) of the activity “Create detailed plan” will be reduced from 10 min to 5 min and that the error ratio (ER) will be reduced (from 20 to 3 % in case of the IntelligentRouting web service). Taking into account an available capacity (CA) of 1,825 working hours per period, a process execution frequency (PE) of 18,250, and a 3 % outage risk (OR) of the web service, direct cost savings of 22,356 € can be expected in period 1. The calculation is based on the assumption of an average advantage of 2.50 € for creating a detailed plan compared to creating an ad-hoc plan.
For the IntelligentRouting  web service a transaction-based pricing model is assumed, with an average calculation rate of 0.25 € per transaction. The payments per period are calculated on the basis of the expected execution frequencies for the task “Create detailed plan” ( rDPto-be). In period 1, for example, 17,702 detailed plans are expected to be created, so the service payments amount to 4,426 €. If the route-planning process is out-tasked, the calculation rate, with a lower risk of outage risk, is 1.05 € per transaction, so the expected payments increase accord-ingly (19,161 €).
In addition to the activity-based payments (TPPOp and TPPOp0), the payments for the process transformation (TPPT) must be taken into consideration. In this case, most of these payments result from investments in the technical infrastructure. Using the IntelligentRouting web service requires the implementation of an enter-prise service bus (ESB) solution. The case example assumes that the company pursues an incremental implementation strategy, so a decision in favor of the IntelligentRouting web service brings about all payments for purchase of technical infrastructure (25,000 €), as well as all follow-up payments for maintenance and adaptation that occur periodically. If the GlobalRoutePlanning service is used, with activities for detailed planning being out-tasked, payments for the technical infra-structure are substantially lower. If GeoDataForLogistics is used, higher payments for the technical infrastructure are expected because of the comparatively high implementation and development effort required.
With  direct  payments  being  consolidated  by  means  of  the  VOFI  capital budgeting method (Grob 1993; vom Brocke and Grob 2011), the future value of investing into the re-organization of the process is: 30,379 € (IntelligentRouting), 25,424 € (GlobalRoutePlanning), and 26,235 € (GeoDataForLogistics). Compared to the future value of the opportunity of an alternative ﬁnancial investment on the capital market, which amounts to 11,425 €  (own equity compounded with an interest rate of 6 %), implementing any service can be considered beneﬁcial to the company. The IntelligentRouting web service is the design alternative that generates the highest additional future value, so the route-planning process should be transformed based on the IntelligentRouting web service.

5   Summary and Outlook

This chapter provides fundamentals on the notion of “value” and its role in BPM. Despite  the  important role that value considerations  play in BPM, the  extant literature reveals a limited understanding of the concept of (economic) value in BPM. We ﬁll this gap by discussing the concept of value in general and in relation to BPM. The chapter highlights three types of value claims in BPM—“could be” value claims, “should be” value claims, and “ought to be” value claims—and distinguishes between the two notions of “value in use” and “value in exchange.” Against  this  background  we  synthesize  prior  research  on  value  in  BPM  and characterize the concept of value-oriented BPM, illustrating it by means of the ROPT,  a measure for evaluating the  economic  consequences of  any business process design activity. This measure can be used to complement further value considerations by putting a price tag on design activities that considers the speciﬁc contextual factors of the related design decisions. The measure expresses the exchange value of a process design, thus helping to balance different value dimen-sions in order to deﬁne “ought to be” processes that are meaningful and supportedin an organization. The differentiated understanding of value creation in BPM can support practitioners in decision-making, and researchers in developing comple-mentary knowledge on value-oriented BPM.









Abstract  The high importance of processes regarding a company’s success has been known for a long time. However, the level of importance of processes, especially in comparison with other success factors, has not been in focus in a consequent matter yet. The research regarding “intangible assets” now provides a new perspective. According to recent research ﬁndings, “process capital” is one of the most important assets of a company. In consequence, process capital has to be built up and managed and has to be a major focus of corporate strategy. On the one hand, the process capital can be the basis for strategy development. On the other hand,  process  capital  is  essential  for  strategy  implementation.  Process  capital management (PCM) is the concept that, in addition to a “classical” process man-agement, also focuses on developing and preserving intangible assets. This chapter gives an introduction to process capital. Then, the correlation between process capital and strategy is analyzed. Furthermore, a suggestion is made regarding the further development of process management toward PCM. Finally, the importance of process capital is illustrated by means of a real-life example from Lufthansa.


1   Process Capital as driver of corporate success

It is almost general knowledge that processes are important to a company’s success. However,itisraretofocusattentiononthelevelofimportanceofprocesses.Therefore, a systematic approach to processes, in part regarding their impact upon corporate success, is necessary in order to manage process potential to its full extent. In order to analyze the role of processes regarding corporate success, research regarding resources as well as regarding success have to be considered. Besides Porter’s market-based approach (cf. Porter 1998), the resource-based approach of Prahalad and Hamel

(cf. Prahalad and Hamel 1990) became one of the two main perspectives of corporate strategy and success. “Establishing competitive advantage involves formulating and implementing a strategy that exploits the uniqueness of a ﬁrm’s portfolio of resources andcapabilities”(Grant2005,p.136f).Itbecamemainstreamthatresourcesareasource ofcreatingcompetitiveadvantageandsuccess.Analyzingthedeterminantsofcorporate success–knownassuccessfactors–ispartofsuccessresearch(e.g.Rockart1979).We distinguish between two types of success factor, internal factors such as resources and external factors such as market share. When looking at company resources, we distin-guish between three categories: ﬁnancial resources, material resources and immaterial resources (known as intangible assets). Empirical testing has shown that intangible assets induce signiﬁcant reactions on the capital market (cf. Lev and Sougiannis 1999). Intangible assets can be deﬁned as “the non-material and non-ﬁnancial resources a company can exploit for longer than the current reporting year” (Gunther et al. 2004, p. 162). In the following deﬁnition from the Schmalenbach Gesellschaft, which is derived from the basis of Edvinsson’s and Malone’s system (cf. Edvinsson andMalone 1997, p. 65), intangibles are broken down into seven categories (cf. WGARIA 2005, p. 68). Within this deﬁnition, process capital is exempliﬁed as a category of intangible assets (see Fig. 1).Accordingly,process capital is understoodas “Intangible values that relatetoanentity’sorganization,primarilyintermsofstructureandprocess”(WGARIA 2005, p. 69). “Examples include a well-functioning distribution and/or communication network, as well as effective quality management processes” (WGARIA 2005, p. 69).
¨
In another deﬁnition, processes are seen as a main component of ‘organizational infrastructure’. This organizational infrastructure embodies “business processes and systems that transform ‘lifeless things’, tangible and intangible, to bundles of assets generating cash ﬂows and conferring competitive positions” (Lev and Daum 2003, p. 7). These authors attach great importance to organizational infrastructure: “[...] organizational infrastructure, when operating effectively, is the major intan-gible of the ﬁrm” (Lev and Daum 2003, p. 7).
In consequence, process capital is created by the existence or development of processes which represent economic advantages. As a result the company’s intan-gible assets are increased.
A detailed deﬁnition of process capital distinguishes between the two compo-nents of process structure (cf. Becker and Kahn 2003) in the sense of an operational structure and process performance (cf. Leyer et al. 2014). From the perspective of a company, the existence of deﬁned processes which conform with corporate busi-ness targets represents a “value”. Based upon the business model a company chooses, the aim is to have and to develop the ‘right’ processes in terms of strategic and operative efﬁciency and effectiveness targets. Thus, for example, HAMMER stresses the effectiveness target: “Processes are what create the results that a company delivers to its customers” (Hammer 2001, p. 53). The existence of the ‘right’ processes enables the company (cf. Mayer 2005, p. 2)

•   to recognize the relevant market trends and to translate these into products faster than the competition,

•   to recognize its target markets and target customer groups and to address and coordinate them appropriately,
•   to establish support processes which provide effective support for the business model and demonstrate benchmarkable efﬁciency,
•   to manage the value-adding processes in such a way as to ensure an optimal division  between  which  activities  are  carried  out  internally  and  which  are outsourced, and
•   to  organize  the  collaboration  with  value-adding  partners  along commercial aspects.

The existence of a deﬁned and (ideally) well-documented process structure alone does not sufﬁce to ensure corporate success and ‘sustainability’ or whether process capital retains its value over time. Rather, the important aim here lies in shaping the processes to conform with the targets they must achieve in terms of costs,  time  and  quality.  This  is  known as  Process  Performance  Management. Process performance has a direct impact upon the central key performance indica-tors of turnover and costs (cf. Mayer 2005, p. 5). Deﬁned processes which satisfy their performance targets are the embodiment of sustainable process capital. If we understand process capital in these terms, it becomes “[...] a sustainable strategic competitive advantage, a dynamic core competency of a company” (Osterloh and Frost 2006, p. 7).
As such, process capital is seen as an extremely important success factor – based on its contribution to company success – compared with the other categories of intangible assets, as shown in empirical studies (cf. Gunther et al. 2005, p. 101ff). Against this background, value-based corporate management should go beyond material assets (e.g. management and controlling of ﬁxed asset investments) and focus on managing and controlling intangible assets, especially process capital. One key aspect should not be ignored: according to OSTERLOH/FROST, process capital only exists when process structure and performance can be deployed to create value, or at least to preserve it. This is the case when processes are aligned with corporate strategy in terms of structure and performance. This then gives rise to the question of how to design and shape processes so they help the company to

reach its strategic ﬁnancial and customer targets. Consequently, these targets should form the starting point for designing all processes – from the innovation process, through the processes for supply chain, operations, market and customer relation-ship, to the processes for internal services. With Business Process Management (BPM), a management concept already exists to this end. However, BPM lacks the goal of preserving and further developing process capital as an intangible asset.
The main focus of this essay is to describe the correlation between process capital and strategy. This correlation will be illustrated by means of a real-life example from Deutsche Lufthansa AG (hereafter Lufthansa). Furthermore, a sug-gestion regarding the further development of BPM towards Process Capital Man-agement is made.



2   The Correlation Between Strategy and Process Capital

2.1	Overview

If we look at the plethora of publications on strategic management (cf. Mintzberg et al. 1998 for an overview of the different schools of thought), we can identify two main questions: How do we substantiate strategy content and how do we implement the deﬁned strategy in the company’s daily business? A company’s existing process capital, or that which needs to be built up, plays an important role in answering these questions. As Chandler said, “Structure follows strategy” (Chandler 1962, p.  14),  and  this  is  often  used  to  exemplify  how  interdependent  strategy  and organization,  and  hence  processes,  are.  If  we  see  strategy  as  the  means  of implementing corporate goals, then it becomes clear that we need processes with which we can plan, execute and monitor measures towards strategy implementation (Burlton 2014). Consequently, processes and process targets must be derived from strategy. An empirical study gave a ﬁtting summary: “Get your strategic objectives aligned with business processes” (Hung 2006, p. 37).
However,  processes  should  also  be  seen  as  strategic  success  factors  when substantiating the content of strategies. Indeed, it is often the case that the key success factor for business models is the company’s ability to master core compe-tencies. Amongst other things, running a successful ‘no-frills’ airline depends on efﬁciently mastering aircraft turnaround and thus reducing ground time. Numerous other examples in industry could be given here to prove the hypothesis of a positive correlation between corporate success and process capital, where processes are seen as core competencies (one prime example would be Google’s internet-based search process). Thus, existing and future process capital must be taken into consideration when formulating strategy. Figure 2 summarizes the interrelationship between strategy and process capital.
On the one hand, the process capital, which consists of processes that are part of a company’s core competencies can be the basis for strategy development. On the

other hand, the deﬁned strategy gives rise to parameters for process structure and performance. We can talk about an interdependence.
Based on the literature cited here, we can assume that both the ability to regard processes as an organization’s core competency when formulating strategy, espe-cially the processes which are ‘visible’ for the recipient, and the ability to accu-rately design and shape process structures and process performance based upon the strategy a company chooses, represent success factors. We explain these success factors in more detail in the following chapters.



2.2	Core Competencies in Process Capital

The underlying idea of aligning strategy with the strengths of a company in the sense  of  core  competencies,  for  example  certain  processes,  results  from  the resource-based approach to strategy. Core competencies can be processes which will play a central role in the future due to the company’s strategic orientation and are already well-established in the company – or can be developed to be so. As a rule, it is difﬁcult for other companies to create or acquire these processes in terms of their structure and/or performance. These  limited resources are difﬁcult to imitate and cannot be substituted (cf. Barney 1991, p. 105f.) and as such are particularly valuable. Consequently, they are also called strategic resources or strategic success factors. Generally, not all of a company’s processes fall into this category. Hence, support processes are regularly well-documented and described by standard IT applications. These outsourceable processes have little impact upon strategy development and implementation.
What do impact upon the development of core competencies, however, are the so-called  core  processes.  “Core  processes  are  processes  that  cross  functional boundaries, produce an output that is strategically important to the organization’s success, and have a high impact on customer satisfaction” (Hung 2000, p. 4). Insofar as the process capital which exists in an organization is unique, cannot be imitated and comprises processes which generate value (core processes), we can consider the idea of aligning strategy with this process capital.
138	M. Brenner et al.

In the following section, we take a look at how process capital can be used to implement strategies.


2.3	Strategy Implementation Using Process Capital

The strategic level represents the “initiating and shaping factor in corporate man-agement” (Ahlrichs and Knuppertz 2006, p. 23). Successful strategy implementa-tion requires its prior operationalization. This, in turn, raises the question of which processes contribute to reaching targets and realizing the strategic plan, and to what extent. This can be seen in the fact that processes are one of the four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard, which is used as an instrument of strategy implementation (cf. Kaplan and Norton 1996).
However, there is a major deﬁcit in traditional corporate management: Strategic and operative planning are usually separated and lack rigorous and consistent linkage. As such, the strategic plan is developed as a requirement for annual operative planning (budgeting) and for mid-term planning in the form of planning premises and target values. While the operative planning budgets and ﬁnancial performance indicators focus on individual organizational units, in terms of stra-tegic targeting we often focus on quantitative and qualitative indicators variables at overall company level. This schism in organizational bearing within the planning system can lead to operative plans being developed whose contribution to strategy implementation cannot be measured. In contrast, however, we can use a process orientation to combine the strategic and operative planning levels by focusing on processes which cross functional and organizational boundaries from strategic targeting all the way through to operative realization (cf. Ahlrichs and Knuppertz 2006, p. 21). The processes are aligned with both strategic and operative targets.
When it comes to implementing strategies, the strategies themselves should be used to derive process-related target values. Hence, if a company decides to pursue the strategy of quality leadership, all its processes must focus on securing the desired  level  of  quality.  The  operational  processes  work  towards  creating  a top-quality product. For marketing and customer relationship processes, this desire for quality must be reﬂected in customer dealings. Within the innovation process, all efforts should be focused on developing top-class products which are difﬁcult for competitors to imitate in terms of the degree of novelty. Since the mid-nineties the Balanced Scorecard has become an established instrument for deriving require-ments from strategy. By using the Balanced Scorecard in combination with a further tool known as the Strategy Map, it becomes possible to substantiate strat-egies and to document the speciﬁc target values which act as yardsticks for the implementation  phase.  From  the  aspect  of  processes,  the  process  perspective deﬁned in the Balanced Scorecard, together with the targets it stipulates, is of particular importance for the strategic ﬁelds of action. Companies which use the Balanced Scorecard already have a ﬁrst focus on processes for the KPI-based implementation of their strategies.
Process Capital as Strategic Success Factor	139

This, however, does not appear to sufﬁce as only the main targets with strategic relevance are considered in a Balanced Scorecard. It is precisely that focus on few targets which KAPLAN/NORTON see as a success factor of the Balanced Score-card. Yet, when we derive the strategic demands upon processes, we actually want to deﬁne comprehensive targets for all strategically relevant processes and be able to measure the extent to which those targets are reached. To do this we need to use KPIs to determine the contribution of process capital to strategy implementation, or the extent to which strategic goals are reached, and to compare this with target values.
It is for this reason that we wish to introduce an instrument known as the Strategic Process Alignment matrix (SPA matrix) as a method of aligning processes with corporate strategy. The SPA matrix establishes formal, KPI-based relations between strategy and those processes with strategic relevance. Thus, strategic requirements upon process performance should be portrayed and made measurable. To do this, we use a matrix to systematically compare the strategic goals, which for example can be taken from a Strategy Map, with the core processes. In this way, we can assess the contribution of process capital to strategy based on the criteria of ‘process relevance’ and ‘degree of target achievement’. Process relevance repre-sents a weighting in percent of how relevant a process is for reaching the strategic goal. As several processes are relevant for achieving a speciﬁc strategic goal, we have to weight the impact of the different processes upon the goal as whole when estimating the percentage values. Hence, we analyze and estimate the extent to which a process should contribute to reaching a speciﬁc strategic target.
Subsequently,  the  demand  upon  the  process  is  speciﬁed  in  the  form  of  a performance indicator, which measures target achievement, and a target value. This is done for each strategic target and ‘relevant’ process. By comparing actual and target values and carrying out deviation analyses, we can monitor and manage the conformity of process performance with strategic targets. Thus, the SPA matrix provides management with a strategy-based process cockpit. In the example SPA matrix portrayed in Fig. 3, the strategic goals were developed in Balanced Score-card workshops. After ﬁnalization of the company’s Strategy Map, another accom-panying workshop was  initiated: Within ‘SPA’ workshops, executed with  the management team, the implications for each process regarding each strategic goal were discussed. As an example, the advisory process of a bank which has a relatively high relevance for the strategic goal ‘Free up front ofﬁce’ fails to meet strategic requirements. This might be due to the fact that this process still has too many high-maintenance communication interfaces to the back ofﬁce, which in turn might be measured using the performance indicator ‘Number of interfaces in process’.
By using the SPA matrix companies are able to track process performance from a strategic point of view. Nevertheless, the following question still remains: how can  companies  design  their  management  system  so  it  systematically  creates process-based values?

3   Process Capital Management

3.1	Overview

After the previous chapters focused on the importance of process capital, we shall now show how process capital can be built up and managed systematically. Before presenting and detailing the necessary tasks and activities, we ﬁrst need to analyze the term Process Capital Management (PCM) in terms of what is commonly called Business Process Management (BPM). ‘Traditional’ process management (BPM) represents a management approach which describes how to manage processes using strategic and  operative  targets. The same  applies  to PCM.  In addition to the classical ‘management’ of processes, however, PCM goes one step further by also focusing on developing and preserving intangible assets. This means that also and especially the relationships of process capital to the other intangible asset categories, for example human capital, are considered and controlled using an integrative management approach (Fig. 4).
Once the concept of process capital has been ﬁrmly anchored in strategy, one of the major tasks consists of actually building up that process capital. Subsequently, we need to implement an appropriate management control system to secure the long-term existence of the process capital stock. These tasks have to be substanti-ated and shaped in the form of a PCM control loop. This control loop should ensure process capital is involved in planning, developing and managing the process capital stock, and ensure that those developments are fed back retrospectively into  the  planning  process.  On  a  sideline  note,  the  tasks  of  PCM  should  be

institutionalized in the company’s organization (e.g. by a process management unit in collaboration with the controlling department) in order to secure the sustainabil-ity of PCM.
In the followingsubsections we describe the tasks mentioned here in more detail.



3.2	Anchoring Process Capitals in the Strategy

One of the ﬁrst tasks we need to carry out is to integrate a ‘perspective’ focusing on process capital into the strategy development and planning process. To do this, we must ﬁrst know and formally describe the company’s processes. Explicit steps aimed at checking the process-based core competencies and their impact upon related ﬁnancial and market performance indicators must be included in the strate-gic planning process. On the one hand, the strategy development phase involves testing the extent to which core competencies arising from the process model might support the strategic options being evaluated. The objectives underlying this step are ﬁrst to prioritize potential strategic actions based upon an analysis of the existing process capital in connection with the strategic options on hand. Second, we need to ﬁnd out which elements of process capital can be developed using speciﬁc measures so as to provide process-based support for the prioritized strategic options.
One further aspect of integrating process capital into the company’s strategy can be found in the phase aimed at operationalizing strategy. By using the SPA matrix described above, we can substantiate the strategy by capturing the requirements for each strategically important process. This then results in performance indicators and target values which are used in the next phase of strategy implementation to track progress at process level. Should deviations from target values occur, these can be recognized at an early stage and we can take the appropriate decisions to modify  strategy  implementation.  Special  attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  the company’s core processes. If there is not enough de facto mastery of these pro-cesses in terms of target values, we need to build up the appropriate process capital needed for strategy implementation.

3.3	Assessing Process Capital

Intangible assets that cannot be identiﬁed, transferred, sold or measured indepen-dently are accounted as a part of the goodwill (cf. WGARIA 2005, p. 75). Generally speaking, goodwill can be deﬁned as the excess of a company’s actual market value over the carrying value (book value) according to the balance sheet. As such, the goodwill could be seen as “[...] a catch-all residual category, a label given to the going concern value of assets in the target company over and above those that can be kicked, or counted, or weighted, or valued with some precision” (Blair and Wallmann 2003, p. 455). This raises the question of how these intangible assets, such as process capital, can be assessed individually, and to what extent.
Generally, individual intangible assets and their values are inherently difﬁcult to measure and to quantify. Due to the fact that intangibles cannot be seen, touched, or weighted, they need to be assessed by using appropriate proxies and measurable variables that can be compared (cf. Blair and Wallmann 2003, p. 454). Besides that, intangible assets can often not be identiﬁed separately. For example, the success of a customer goods company can be derived from good customer relations and well established brands (customer capital), from high-developed and efﬁcient processes (process  capital)  as  well  as  from  permanent  product  innovations  (innovation capital) (cf. Gladen 2011, p. 136). Therefore, a unique identiﬁcation and allocation to a speciﬁc category of intangible assets is both difﬁcult and very often impractical (cf. WGARIA 2005, p. 89). In addition, traditional accounting standards cannot be very  helpful  in  providing  information  about  intangible  assets.  In  most  cases, accounting rules do not allow a capitalization of internally generated intangibles in a company’s balance sheet and “generally require that internal expenditures on intangible assets [...], treated as expenses in the period in which they are incurred and charged against current earnings” (Blair and Wallmann 2003, p. 455).
Nevertheless,  in  order  to  manage  a  company’s  intangible  assets  and  their development, it is of high importance to ﬁnd solutions for assessing intangibles with  appropriate  methods  and  measurable  ﬁgures.  Accordingly,  for  example, KAPLAN/NORTEN point out the importance of considering the contribution of intangible assets to performance targets as the “holy grail of management account-ing” (Kaplan and Norton 2004, p. 52). Indeed, appropriate information could help a company’s management “to make resource allocation decisions and to engage employees, business partners, and other participants in value-creating activities” (Blair and Wallmann 2003, p. 458). This can be illustrated by taking the example of banks again. In banks, especially in their back-ofﬁces, most core competencies can be characterized as intangibles, such as save and efﬁcient processes. In recent years, there has been a trend of industrialization in banking (cf. Loos and Coners 2006, p. 204). This means, brieﬂy worded, that bank’s revise their operation models by simplifying and standardizing products, processes and technologies. This initiates many optimization projects with high cost impact and strategic relevance. Against this background, decision making attaches a vital importance to reliable informa-tion about intangible assets in order to evaluate these optimization projects.

Fig. 5  Indirect und direct methods for assessing process capital

This leads to the initial question: how can process capital be assessed? In general, we distinguish between direct and indirect methods here (as portrayed in Fig. 5 “Indirect und direct methods for assessing process capital”). Direct methods reveal efﬁciency changes directly at process level and quantitatively assess their inﬂuences on the existing process capital. While indirect methods qualitatively assess the general state of process capital through comparable indicators.
The direct methods described here are based on LEV, who proposed an assess-ment of process capital by quantitatively measuring efﬁciency before and after optimization efforts (cf. Lev and Daum 2003). In this way, value-creating improve-ments could be revealed and their impact on process capital could be assessed quantitatively.  One  corresponding  approach  for  measuring  changes  in process capital could be a value-oriented BPM, which reveals the value contribution of processes by determining changes in their payment surpluses (cf. vom Brocke and Grob 2011; vom Brocke et al. 2010; Buhl et al. 2011, p. 169). This could be used for valuing process efﬁciency and optimizations with ﬁnancial measures. This means processes could be assessed quantitatively with their impact on a company’s value, and, in addition, on the process capital. Another direct quantitative approach could be Activity-based Costing (ABC), which assigns related costs to each activity in a process. In this way, process optimization projects could be valued by determining their cost saving potentials, which represent economic advantages and therefore the creation of process capital. But, however, these results only cover the cost saving potentials for single optimization projects and can only be used for assessing the changes in process capital. Neither a value-oriented BPM nor activity-based costing could make an assessment of process capital in total.
This raises the question of how process capital can be assessed as a consistent unit. In this context, maturity models provide an applicable approach  for the assessment of a company’s capability in Business Process Management (BPM). Thus,  considering  that  process  capital  is  correlated  with  a  company’s  BPM
144	M. Brenner et al.

capability, maturity models can be a method for assessing process capital indirectly from a qualitative point of view.
The main purposes of maturity models are to answer the question of how advanced a company is in their BPM development, to guide process improvement initiatives, and to control progress (cf. Iversen et al. 1999). For this reason the general concept of maturity models contains a sequence of maturity levels, which represents the typical evolution path of BPM improvement. The lowest level stands for an initial state that indicates little BPM capabilities. In contrast, the highest level represents a stage of total maturity. Each level provides essential criteria and elements of effective and efﬁcient processes, which need to be fulﬁlled to reach the next maturity level on the evolution path. Hence, an improved maturity results “in an increase in the process capability of the organisation” (Paulk et al. 1993, p. 5). As an example of BPM maturity models, the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) (SEI 2011) could be considered. CMMI “is an internationally recognized model for process improvement and is used worldwide by thousands of organizations” (O’Regan 2011, p. 44). The CMMI consists of ﬁve maturity levels (see Fig. 6). The lowest level of maturity is level 1 and the highest level is maturity level 5. Each maturity level contains several process areas, which describe speciﬁc and generic goals for improvement. For example, the maturity level 2 contains the process area “Measurement and Analysis”, which determines speciﬁc management information needs and measurement objectives that need to be fulﬁlled to reach the

next level of maturity. In this way, CMMI provides an instrument for the assess-ment of BPM capabilities as well as for the improvement of process performance. In addition, CMMI allows organizations to benchmark themselves against similar organizations (cf. O’Regan 2011, p. 46ff.).
Taking into consideration that process capital is correlated with a company’s BPM capability, maturity models such as CMMI, provide a practical approach for an  indirect  assessment  of  process  capital.  This  means,  for  example,  that  an improved maturity level indicates a growing process capital. Thus, maturity models allow assessing the state of process capital, evaluating its general contribution to strategic goals as well as identifying possibilities for its further improvement. However, with regard to a sufﬁcient determination and interpretation, two key aspects should be noted. First, as outlined before, process capital is created by the existence  or  development  of  processes  which  represent  economic  advantages. Consequently,  only  value-creating  processes  (core  processes)  which  represent these advantages, should be taken into account when assessing a company’s BPM maturity  in  terms  of  process  capital.  The  second  aspect  is  that  the  different intangible asset categories are closely connected to each other and difﬁcult to separate. Therefore, comparable measures are required, which allow a more com-prehensive analysis of all intangible asset categories and their relationships regard-ing an integrative performance measurement (cf. Gladen 2011, p. 136). In order to create comparable measures of process capital, maturity states could be the basis for further enhancements with ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures.
It should not be ignored, that the existing approaches cannot measure the value of process capital to its full extent. Taking into account that other intangible assets can be measured with some precision (e.g. customer capital by using the customer lifetime value), particular needs for research into the assessment of process capital can be demonstrated.


3.4	Building Up Process Capital

We can build up the process capital needed to secure strategy implementation by carrying out process design and optimization measures (business process optimi-zation). In this way, the process structure and performance required (usually at short notice) for strategy implementation can be created. However, this is not enough to secure sustainable process capital, since carrying out process transformations is not only extremely resource-intensive, it also represents a considerable burden upon the company’s employees. For this reason it is advisable to create an environment which is conducive to systematically developing process capital as a permanent core competency for the company. Several factors play an important role here: process culture, change management and human capital. Process culture should be seen  as  taking  overriding  priority  and  should  be  closely  connected  with  the company’s organizational structures, in the sense of being the “complete and self-evident  classiﬁcation  and  execution  of  all  business  activities  in  the  form  of

processes” (Ahlrichs and Knuppertz 2006, p. 43). In this way, employees are not connected with one another primarily through the company’s hierarchy, but rather through the processes. The resultant reduction in the number of organizational interfaces can lead to more efﬁcient communication and a more ﬂexible corporate structure. Alongside process culture, change management represents a signiﬁcant contribution to establishing process capital. On the one hand, building up process capital involves changing ‘hard facts’, such as the structure of processes and the organizational structure. On the other hand, ‘soft factors’ also change, for example the behavior of employees as process owners. Special importance is attached here to processes of learning and change which focus on ensuring an organization is capable of adapting (for example by employee multi-skilling) to dynamic changes in the conditions affecting process execution (for example change in strategy, collapse in demand etc.). This also makes another category of intangible assets particularly important for sustainable process capital: human capital, insofar as this shapes, executes and controls the processes. A reduction in the number of hierarchy levels,  accompanied  by  a  focus  on  end-to-end  processes,  can  for  example strengthen the employees’ personal sense of responsibility, which ought to result in the creation of creativity potentials due to the existence of a common mindset. Against this background, raising innovation capital can in turn lead to the devel-opment of new, innovative processes (cf. Becker and Kahn 2011, p. 8). Human capital is a major platform for building up process capital, as can be seen in Fig. 7. Initially, we need to establish an awareness of the existence of intellectual capital in the organization (‘Visualization of intellectual capital’). We must create an in-depth understanding among staff about actual and target processes using employee programs and change management methods. This will enable process capital to develop into practical and applicable knowledge which can be used to create value in the company. By combining this with human capital (‘Injection of human capital’), the organization’s processes can be enhanced and improved. These
Process Capital as Strategic Success Factor	147

newly (documented and) acquired skills and knowledge result in actual process capital as a core competency ﬁrmly anchored in the organization (‘Transformation of human capital into process capital’). As these competencies can be traced back to methods and techniques, they are no longer tied to individual employees and are hence ﬁrmly and permanently anchored in the company (portrayed as the ‘Injection of process capital’ in Fig. 7).



3.5	Managing Process Capital

Companies wishing to build up process capital must permanently analyze their processes in terms of performance: process ﬂows need to be questioned and, if necessary, modiﬁed to ﬁt new situations. We can use PCM here to comprise planning, organizational and control measures for managing the value chain in terms of costs, time, quality, and – as a consequence – customer satisfaction.
Here, process controlling plays a central role, which can be seen as aligning planning, control and management to those processes being examined (cf. Leyer et al. 2014). The main task of process controlling is to make processes measurable and hence to provide the institutionalized information necessary for process con-trol. To do this, process controlling instruments can be used. Depending on their speciﬁc data and analysis focus, these can be classiﬁed based on whether they serve to measure strategic or operative performance. Examples of strategically oriented instruments include the SPA matrix mentioned earlier and activity-based costing (ABC), a tool for strategic cost management (cf. Kaplan and Anderson 2004). To measure and analyze operative process performance, we could, for example, carry out business activity monitoring (cf. Wang 1999) and data mining using process-related databases (cf. van der Aalst et al. 2003). The aim here is to facilitate early recognition of problems in process ﬂows in order to be able to initiate suitable and timely counter-measures.
The information provided should contain statements about the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the processes. To this end, it is necessary to deﬁne and measure performance indicators which inﬂuence the success of the processes (cf. Leyer et al. 2014). Alongside ﬁnancial indicators such as process cost rates, these are mainly non-ﬁnancial variables which focus on time (e.g. run time) and quality (e.g. error rate for process output). Process controlling does not only comprise measuring and reporting performance indicators, however.In fact, itactually reﬂects the ‘classical’ understandingof controlling in that it deals with planning and monitoring targets, as well as initiating countermeasures. In terms of process controlling, this means we need to deﬁne process targets, to regularly measure the extent to which those targets are reached, and, if necessary, to set appropriate reactions to deviations from plan in motion. In this way, we can ﬁrmly anchor the development of processes into the company (cf. Neumann et al. 2011, p. 234).

4   Case Study: Lufthansa AG

4.1	Example of Lufthansa’s Process Capital

Case study research can be regarded as a common approach to verifying or negating scientiﬁc statements (cf. Yin 2008). In the following we try to illustrate the PCM concept by means of Lufthansa. All information regarding the Lufthansa case study is  based  on  publicly  available  documents.  The  authors  have  interpreted  core competencies and processes as process capital. Many of its core competencies, which are mandatory for Lufthansa’s strategy, can be contributed to process capital. As the airline industry in Europe has been characterized by a movement towards concentration in recent years, one of Lufthansa’s important strategic goals is to grow, either organically, or through cooperations and takeovers. Consequently, through its complete acquisition of the Swiss airline Swiss and Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa has been able to gain considerable ground in important markets. How-ever, integrating another airline into its own network is not an easy task. Lufthansa has proven to have the right processes for such integration work. In particular, the takeover of Swiss and its subsequent integration into Lufthansa’s route network can be seen as a prime example of the importance of process capital. Integrating other airlines into one’s own route network is a substantial undertaking as each and every airline has its own very individual characteristics. Alongside such factors as having different aircraft types, integrating the systems (route network, IT systems etc.) represents an especially challenging hurdle. The availability of a process which can incorporate other airlines into Lufthansa’snetworkrepresents a key core process for Lufthansa.  Lufthansa  is  able  to  tap  into  prior  experience.  Back  in  1997,  the company  was  the  initiator  and  founding  member  of  the  airline  network  Star Alliance. The skills and  abilities  Lufthansa  developed here  in a  multitude  of operations processes and in particular the process of integration manifest them-selves  as  process  capital.  The  company  can  now  rely  upon  this  resource  for takeovers and other integration activities, using it to create value.
Besides this process capital necessary for integration work, there is another prime example for process capital in the company’s daily business. Lufthansa’s aircraft maintenance processes, which are core processes, are best practice in the aviation world. As one result, Lufthansa has one of the highest reputations regard-ing safety in the market and is considered to be quality leader. As another result, Lufthansa’s strategy is inﬂuenced by these maintenance processes. These processes are not only used to maintain its own ﬂeet. Instead, Lufthansa formed a separate unit, Lufthansa Technik, which offers maintenance services to the market.

4.2	Strategy Implementation at Lufthansa Based on Process Capital

Let us now use the example of Lufthansa to demonstrate how process capital can be used to implement strategy. One of the most important strategic goals for Lufthansa is quality and innovation leadership. First we must check to see which processes are relevant to achieve these goals and to determine the requirements towards these processes. As an example, the processes ‘Passenger handling’, ‘In-ﬂight service’ and  ‘Operations’  are  used.  These  processes  all  contribute  signiﬁcantly  to  the strategic goals of quality and innovation leadership. In a second step, the goals have  to  be  speciﬁed  for  each  process  and  changes  or  improvements  deﬁned. Regarding the processes used as example, based on the SPA-Matrix the following process changes were deﬁned by Lufthansa (Fig. 8).


4.2.1	Passenger Handling

Handling passengers consists of all land and airside processes until the passenger has boarded the aircraft. Lufthansa has derived measures from strategy to signiﬁ-cantly  improve  this  process.  Regarding  quality,  the  company  has  designed  a top-class product. Speciﬁc services for top customers, such as special lounges and limousine transfer to the aircraft (for ﬁrst class passengers and members of theHON level in the frequent ﬂier program) mean Lufthansa now leads the industry in this ﬁeld. Regarding innovation, homeprint boarding passes and check-in by mobile phone offer convenient ways to check in. It is obvious that in order to be able to offer the same high-end travel experience for all customers worldwide, or at least for  customers  to  feel  this  is  what  they  are  receiving  (service  quality),  the

appropriate processes must be deﬁned at every individual stage (process structure) and carried out in the same way (process performance). This means the current strategy is implemented by setting up a suitable process structure and by monitoring process performance. After successful implementation, these processes form key factors which distinguish Lufthansa from its competitors and the process capital represents a corresponding value for the company.


4.2.2	In-ﬂight Service

Another example is the in-ﬂight service process. Lufthansa invested huge amounts of time and money on improving seating. The airline recently introduced a new ﬁrst class as well as a new business class product for international services. The seats allow travelers to sleep more comfortably and better. Another innovation regarding customer experience was the introduction of in-ﬂight internet access.


4.2.3	Operations

Not only in passenger-related processes is innovation a goal which Lufthansa implements in its processes. Several process innovations have been introduced: By the use of the “Aircraft Addressing Communication and Reporting System”, data of aircrafts operating worldwide is sent to the Trafﬁc Control Center in Frankfurt and analyzed. Potential faults can immediately be detected. Lufthansa also introduced what is known as the ‘electronic ﬂight bag’. This system, developed by the subsidiary Lufthansa Systems, replaces lots of paper-based documentation which has to be available in the cockpit (e.g. maps). Each year, up to 16 million pieces of paper can be replaced with up-to-date information.
All these examples improve Lufthansa’s processes signiﬁcantly with goals out of strategy.  Lufthansa  can  increase  quality  and  customer  satisfaction.  Innovative processes also result in higher efﬁciency.
Finally, in order to secure the process performance and the sustainability of process capital, a Process Capital Management has to be established. As described in Sect. 2.3, a set of performance indicators is used in order to specify the goals to be achieved. The “increase” in process capital can be measured by the change of these indicators.



5   Summary and Outlook

Countless publications from both academia and industry deal with the importance of processes for corporate success. In most cases, selected examples of process optimizations and process management success stories are described without really proving which share of corporate success can actually be attributed to processes.
Process Capital as Strategic Success Factor	151

This essay looks at this topic from a different perspective: using intangible assets – which have come to the fore in recent years – as a starting point, the intangible category of process capital is subjected to close scrutiny.
Based upon a deﬁnition of the term process capital and a description of the correlation between process capital and strategy, this essay shows how process capital can be built up as a strategic success factor and managed permanently and consistently. Here it is important to remember that while extensive literature can be found on other areas of research into intangibles, such as human capital, to date there have been very few investigations into process capital. As such, this article should demonstrate the need for further research and provide impulses for a more detailed analysis of the topic. There is particular need for research into the positive correlation between process capital and PCM and corporate success postulated in this article. The use of empirical research methods (e.g. interviews with experts) would lend itself to this end.









Abstract  In Business Process Management (BPM) research as well as in practice, a whole host of different Business Process Frameworks supporting various tasks connected with BPM in organizations have been introduced and further developed. However, the term Business Process Framework is ambiguous and has been used for different BPM-related systemization approaches concerning BPM methods and techniques. Against the background that so far no attempt to systemize the different meanings and understandings of the term Business Process Framework is known, this article aims at clarifying this term by analyzing and systemizing its different facets giving an overview of available understandings and usages of the term. The identiﬁed facets are investigated and several different classes of Business Process Frameworks  are  described  and  explained  in  more  detail.  In  this  context, one predominant class of Business Process Frameworks summarizing business process reference models is presented in more detail.


1   Introduction

Business Process Management (BPM) gains more and more importance for practice and an increasing number of organizations use BPM methods and techniques in order to support their operations (Fettke 2009). This makes BPM a highly relevant object of study and development for researchers and practitioners who strive for designing new and innovative BPM approaches and, furthermore, investigate their effects in real world application. In this context, BPM research and practice has created a whole host of so called Business Process Frameworks supporting different tasks connected with BPM in organizations. However, the term Business Process

Framework is ambiguous and has been used to denominate different BPM-related systemization approaches, BPM methods and techniques etc. The term has not been consistently deﬁned and various understandings can be identiﬁed in literature until now.  This  word  sense  ambiguity has  already  been mentioned  before,  e.g.  by Harmon (2014) and process frameworks have been identiﬁed an important element of strategic alignment in BPM (Rosemann and vom Brocke 2014). However, so far no attempt to systemize the different meanings and understandings of the term Business Process Framework is currently known and so the term has remained ambiguous.
Against this background, this article aims at further clarifying the term Business Process Framework by means of an investigation and systemization of its different facets and an overview of a selection of different understandings and usages of this term in literature shall be given. Another goal of this article is to clarify the various facets of the term Business Process Framework and the different classes of Business Process Frameworks by means of a more detailed description and explanation of several Business Process Framework instances.
In  order  to  reach the  goal  of  further  clarifying  the  term  Business  Process Framework, a review and investigation of selected articles referring to Business Process Frameworks is our research approach. We report on different usages and understandings of the term Business Process Framework in literature and systemize different  identiﬁable  instances  into  consistent  classes  of  Business  Process Frameworks.
This article is structured as follows: after this introduction, the second section analyses the ambiguity of the term Business Process Framework in more detail based on an investigation of frameworks in the context of BPM research and the clariﬁcation of different possible facets of the term business process as well as the term framework. A classiﬁcation of identiﬁed understandings of the term Business Process Framework is given. In Sect. 3, each of the different Business Process Framework  classes  are  described  in  more  detail  and  explained  by  means  of according  framework instances.  In this  context, we  especially focus  on some Business Process Framework instances in the sense of business process reference models and also report on empirical insights concerning real world effects of using reference models in practice. Section 4, discusses the ﬁndings of our investigation before the article is summarized and concluded in Sect. 5.



2   Business Process Frameworks: An Ambiguous Term

2.1	Frameworks in Business Process Management Research

Frameworks in general are highly relevant in the context of Information Systems (IS) research as they commonly provide a systemization or overview of relevant objects or phenomena in a certain domain of interest. The general term framework has, furthermore, quite often been used in the context of BPM research addressing a
Business Process Frameworks	155

whole host of different aspects of BPM, e.g. Rosemann and vom Brocke (2014) develop a framework for the description of Six Core Elements of BPM which supports structuring BPM as a holistic approach; Tregear (2014) introduces a Global BPM framework for process standardization supporting BPM in globalized organizations; Bhat et al. (2014) differentiate several classes of Business Process Management Frameworks, e.g. maturity models with according assessment tools as well as BPM lifecycle  methodologies (pp. 333f.) and use a speciﬁc Business Process Management Adoption Framework in order to investigate Business Process Outsourcing effects. In summary, frameworks play an important role in BPM research and the term Business Process Management Framework has been used for the description of many different aspects of BPM.
This plurality of meaning can also be observed for the term Business Process Framework. In  literature,  the  term  Business  Process  Framework  is  used  very differently, e.g. Harmon (2014) mentions this ambiguity but predominantly under-stands Business Process Frameworks as reference process models or organizational best practices like the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) or the Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM), while Scheer (1998) uses the term Business Process Frameworks in the sense of methodical engineering approaches for business pro-cesses and process-oriented IS addressing technical infrastructure, organizational aspects as well as existing business objects. Table1 gives an exemplary overview of different usages and understandings of the term Business Process Framework in literature.
This exemplary enumeration of different usages of the term Business Process Framework illustrates the mentioned term ambiguity in literature. We assume that this ambiguity is related to two different aspects: the ambiguity of the term business process as well as the ambiguity of the term framework.


2.2	Term Clariﬁcation “Business Process”

According to the Cambridge Dictionary1 a process in general is “a series of actions that you take in order to achieve a result”. The term business process can accord-ingly be understood as a sequence of actions carried out in a business context for the creation of goods and services. In common speaking as well as in literature the term business process can occur in different contexts. For the clariﬁcation of its meaning it is important to ask, whether (a) a business process in the real world or in the model world is addressed and, furthermore, (b) if we are talking about a business process instance or a business process schema. The inﬂuence of these two dimen-sions will be explained in more detail in the following.
As already mentioned, the term business process can address both sequences of executions which can be observed in the real world and sequences of intended

executions documented in the form of a process model (model world). A clear differentiation between the term business process related to the real world on the one hand and related to the model world on the other hand seems highly important as this term indeed has different meanings depending on the context. As far as the model world is concerned, a business process can be represented in different ways and using different types of methods and techniques (Desel and Juhas 2001). In literature, a common classiﬁcation differentiates (I.) informal, (II.) semi-formal and (III.) formal representations of business processes. However, there are also different opinions  in  literature  concerning  how  these  classes  of  representations  can  be distinguished in detail and what the exact criteria for this differentiation are.
´
The mentioned (I.) informal representations are typically considered to comprise business process description in free prose (Markovic 2010), e.g. a transcript of an interview with an employee concerning the sequences of executions commonly performed at her workplace for the documentation of as-is processes.
As natural language can be ambiguous and is likely to be interpreted differently, there have been several initiatives towards the development of formalized business process  representations.  A  ﬁrst  step  towards  a  more  formal  and  standardized representation of business processes has been the introduction and usage of graph-ical elements and symbols with a standardized meaning in graphical business process models. This resulted in methods and techniques which support – besides several  other  tasks  –  the  development  of  technical  drawings  of  processes, e.g. Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs), the Business Process Model and Nota-tion (BPMN) or UML Activity diagrams.In literature, such representations are often considered  to  be  (II.)  semi-formal.  One  important  purpose  of  these  modeling techniques is the graphical representation of business processes.
However, in the meanwhile several of these business process representation techniques have been further developed and stronger formalizations have been proposed in order to have a (III.) formal representation of business process models, e.g. for EPCs by van der Aalst (1999) or Nuttgens and Rump (2002). In this context, two   different   types   of   formalizations   can   be   distinguished:   (a)   formal
¨
158	C. Houy et al.

representations by means of mathematical expressions and structures based on set theory or ﬁrst-order logic, and (b) formal representations by means of a formal language  in  the  sense  of  the  ﬁeld  of  theoretical  computer  science.  A  formal language in the sense of theoretical computer science is a ﬁnite set of strings of symbols (Davis et al. 1994). In this context, formal languages can support several different purposes: (1) the provision of a machine-readable representation of a process model in order to make them interchangeable,e.g. the Event-driven Process Chain Markup Language (EPML) or the ARIS markup language (AML) for EPC models, and (2) the provision of a machine-readable representation of a process model in order to make them executable by means of a process engine (execution semantics).
Furthermore, as already mentioned above the exact meaning of the term business process also depends on the differentiation between process instances (tokens) or process schemata (types). This results in the following classes of business processes (represented in Fig. 1):

1. According to the above deﬁnition of a business process, a business process instance in the real world describes a unique and singularly happening sequence of executions in a business context, e.g. production process #1111 concerning article#2222 performed onthe 1th of July 2013 in the Example Company’s plant #15. Its existence is actually independent of the existence of a process model or an information system.
2. A business process schema in the real world is the common schema of execution steps which all the production processes in an organization typically follow, e.g. concerning the article #2222 produced by the Example Company. This schema does not necessarily have to be documented by means of a process model and is actually also independent of an IS.
3. A business  process  instance  in the model  world  is the unique graphical or informal representation (e.g. EPC diagram or a textual description printed on one particular sheet of paper), or a formal representation (EPML code running on one particular computer) of a sequence of executions in a business context. The latter example typically represents a process instance in the real world, e.g. a currently running workﬂow instance. However, as already mentioned above, a process model can exist independently of a business process in the real world and vice versa.
4. A business process schema in the model world is a graphical (e.g. EPC diagram), a formal (e.g. EPML code) or an informal (e.g. prose) representation of a documented, intended or suggested sequence of executions, e.g. a business process model which is contained in the SAP reference model.

In conclusion, it can be stated that the term business process can have several different meanings. Thus, the underlying understanding ofbusiness process is likely to inﬂuence intended meanings of the term Business Process Framework, which will also be indicated in the following sections in more detail.

2.3	Term Clariﬁcation “Framework”

As already mentioned, the development of frameworks plays an important role in IS research. However, the term framework is generally used in many different senses in IS research and, as has been shown, especially in the context of BPM research. This is probably also related to the fact that the general English term framework has several different meanings. Besides other meanings which are probably less impor-tant for IS research, e.g. the parts of a building or an object that support its weight and give it shape, framework – according to the Cambridge Dictionary2 as well as the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary3 – can have the following meanings:

1. a set of beliefs, ideas or rules that is used as the basis for making judgements, decisions, etc. and
2. the structure of a particular system.

Both interpretations are valid for BPM research compared to the different usages and understandings of the term Business Process Framework which we have seen in Table 1. This will also be shown in more detail after the introduction of our classiﬁcation  of  the  usages  and  understandings  of  the  term  Business  Process Framework in literature by means of a mapping of these two meanings of the term framework onto our Business Process Framework classes in the following section.

2.4	A Classiﬁcation of Business Process Frameworks

As we have already seen, several different classes of Business Process Frameworks can be identiﬁed in literature. During our investigation, we discovered that in some of the contributions the term Business Process Framework has been used as a shorter form for unique and speciﬁc frameworks in the context of BPM like the Business Process Knowledge Framework by Hrastnik et al. (2007) or the Business Process Framework in the sense of a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices  for  BPM  by  Karagiannis  and  Woitsch  (2014).  Moreover,  we  found characteristic usages and understandings of the term Business Process Framework which can be identiﬁed signiﬁcantly more often than others in literature. In the following, these serve as our Business Process Framework classes. Figure 2 sum-marizes these characteristic classes.
The ﬁrst major class of Business Process Frameworks in our classiﬁcation subsumes methodical business process engineering approaches, e.g. the Architec-ture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) (Scheer 1998), the Zachman Frame-work  (Zachman  1987),  the  Computer  Integrated  Manufacturing  Open  System Architecture (CIMOSA) (AMICE 1993) etc. Such engineering approaches support the development of process-oriented IS, the deﬁnition of process models and not only  propose  the  structure  of  such  IS  but  sometimes  also  provide  according procedure models and according software implementations supporting BPM in practice. For such Business Process Frameworks the second meaning of the general term framework given above (structure of a system) is relevant in the ﬁrst place as these business process engineering approaches basically provide systemizations of underlying structures of process-oriented IS. However, they also provide certain beliefs, ideas and rules for taking decisions for the design of such systems. Thus, also the second given meaning of frameworks applies for this Business Process Frameworks class.
The second Business Process Frameworks class summarizes technical infra-structures  for  process  integration  and  for  the  interchange  of  business  process models, e.g. XML-based approaches like the XML Process Deﬁnition Language (XPDL) or the ebXML Business Process (ebBP) OASIS standard. These technical infrastructures provide the basis for formal representations of business process models (model world) and the execution of singular process instances in the real world by means of workﬂow systems. Concerning this Business Process Frame-works class, the second meaning of framework which is related to structural aspects of a system is relevant.
The third major class which also represents the most common understanding of the  term  Business  Process Framework summarizes  so called business process reference  models  which  are  often  representations  of  best  practice  processes, e.g.  the  Supply  Chain  Operations  Reference  Model  (SCOR),  the  Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) or the Control Objectives for Information and  Related  Technology  (COBIT).  Reference  models  are  process  descriptions (model  world)  which  can  provide  the  basis  for  real  world  process  instances.

2. Technical Infrastructures for Process Integration and Process Model Interchange

3. Business Process Blueprints or Reference Process Models


Fig. 2  An overview of different types of Business Process Frameworks

Looking at the interpretation of Business Process Frameworks in the sense of reference models, both of the above meanings of the term framework are relevant. Reference models are often interpreted as prescriptions of how a real world business processes could or should be conducted. They contain certain believes and ideas aiming at the improvement of a process-oriented organization. Furthermore, the structural aspects of reference process models are especially important as business process  models  represent  a  structure  of  work  in  an  organizational  system  or sub-system.
In the following section, these different classes of Business Process Frameworks and selected instances of Business Process Frameworks are presented in more detail. We ﬁrst introduce exemplary Business Process Frameworks in the sense of business process engineering approaches, then some exemplary technical infra-structures for process integration and process model interchange before we put a stronger focus on established business process reference models.



3   Description of Exemplary Business Process Frameworks

3.1	Methodical Business Process Engineering Approaches

A whole host of methodical engineering approaches for process-oriented IS have been presented in literature. Furthermore, several according software prototypes exist. Therefore, we can only introduce a selection of Business Process Frameworks in this sense in the following. However, these frameworks have in common that they typically provide a systemization of domain-independent approaches, methods and techniques for the development of process-oriented IS considering different views and perspectives on involved systems and business processes.
The Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) is a comprehensive methodical framework for the design of process-oriented IS. It provides a holistic view on business processes comprising the organizational view, the data view, the function view, the output view and the control view (Scheer 1998). In addition, the ARIS phase model deﬁnes several consecutive development phases (requirements
162	C. Houy et al.

deﬁnition, IS concept and implementation description) which are relevant for each view  and,  furthermore,  necessary  for  a  structured  development  of  integrated IS. Besides offering an architecture for process-oriented IS, the ARIS concept provides the basis for several concrete modeling methods and techniques as well as software implementations for business process modeling. The ARIS platform offers comprehensive functionality in the context of BPM in general, e.g. the development of the business process strategy, business process implementation, business process monitoring or business process controlling.4
The Zachman Framework was initially developed in the late 1980s as a domain-independent approach providing guidelines and a systemization of roles and per-spectives as well as and their speciﬁc requirements which should be considered during the development of IS (Zachman 1987). Based on the insight that the size and complexity  of IS implementations as well  as enterprises  in general  keep increasing and, furthermore, that individual perspectives on a complex system matter (“Architecture is relative. What you think architecture is depends on what you are doing”, Zachman 1987, p. 291) this systemization of relevant roles (planer, owner, designer, builder, programmer and user, p. 284ff.) and perspectives (data, function, network, people, time and motivation) for individual IS development has been proposed as a two-dimensional framework and further developed  into a comprehensive multi-dimensional Enterprise Architecture Framework.5
The Computer Integrated Manufacturing Open System Architecture (CIMOSA) has been developed in the early 1990s (AMICE 1993). Although the underlying research projects of this initiative focussed on the development of an open system architecture for CIM, the CIMOSA can support enterprise modeling in general and has some similarities compared with ARIS (Scheer 1998). The CIMOSA architec-ture (the CIMOSA cube) is represented by three dimensions: the “stepwise gener-ation” dimension ( function view, information view, resource view and organization view) which is comparable to the views in ARIS, “stepwise derivation” (require-ments deﬁnition, design speciﬁcation, implementation description) which is com-parable to the ARIS phase concept and “stepwise instantiation” which describes the necessary individualization of concepts during the development from basic require-ments (generic), to industry speciﬁc requirements (partial) to enterprise speciﬁc requirements (particular) (Scheer 1998). Former and current research on CIMOSA as well as software implementations supporting enterprise modeling according to the  CIMOSA  approach  can  be  accessed  via  the  website  of  the  CIMOSA Association.6
Additionally, we would like to mention further examples of Business Process Frameworks in the sense of methodical business process engineering approaches which are of relevance for Enterprise Modeling and BPM such as Multi-Perspective Enterprise Modelling (MEMo) by Frank (1994), the Semantic Object Model (SOM)

by Ferstl and Sinz (1995), ProMet by Osterle (1995) or The Open Group Architec-ture Framework (TOGAF).7 In the following section Business Process Frameworks in the sense of technical infrastructures for process integration and process model interchange will be treated.
¨



3.2	Technical Infrastructures for Process Integration and Process Model Interchange

The second major class of Business Process Frameworks summarizes technical infrastructures for process integration and process model interchange. In this area, several different speciﬁcations have been developed based on the speciﬁc tasks which are supposed to be supported, e.g. process  model interchange between different modeling or workﬂow tools, inter-organizational process integration or web service orchestration. In the following, some examples of such technical infrastructures will be presented in order to further clarify this speciﬁc interpreta-tion of the term Business Process Framework.
The XML Process Deﬁnition Language (XPDL) is an XML-based standard for the exchange of business process models and has been developed and advanced by the Workﬂow Management Coalition (WfMC) since 1993. The current version 2.2 has  been  released  in  2012  and  supports  a  graphical  representation  of  XPDL speciﬁcations by means of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0 standard.8  Furthermore, XPDL facilitates the interchange of BPMN diagrams in general, also for earlier versions of the BPMN up to version 1.2.9 This distinguishes XPDL from similar XML-based standards like the Web Services Business Process Execution  Language  (WS-BPEL)  which  mainly  focusses  on  business  process execution and not so much on graphical representation aspects. WS-BPEL is a description language for business processes comprising functions and activities which are implemented as web services.10  The WS-BPEL has been extended by the so called WS-BPEL Extension for People (BPEL4People) speciﬁcation which additionally   considers   process   activities   conducted   by   humans   in   BPEL processes.11
The ebXML Business Process (ebBP) OASIS standard is another XML-based standard for the technical speciﬁcation of business processes.12 It especially aims at supporting inter-organizational business process integration and is based on the former  process  integration  standard  eBusiness  Extensible  Markup  Language

(ebXML) which has also been developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS).13
Besides these quite current business process integration approaches, many other technical infrastructures and approaches exist –some of them meanwhile obsolete – like Workﬂow-XML (Wf-XML) by the WfMC14 or the Business Process Modeling Language (BPML) by the Business Process Management Initiative (BPMI).15  In the following section, we present several Business Process Frameworks in the sense of business process reference models in more detail.



3.3	Business Process Reference Models

3.3.1	What Is a Business Process Reference Model?

The term business process reference model has not been consistently deﬁned and there is still a lively discussion which aspects this term comprises. This discussion shall not be comprehensively recapitulated in this contribution. In general, business process reference models can be understood as business process models which should fulﬁl certain criteria and offer certain features. These criteria are still under discussion, e.g. in (vom Brocke 2003; Thomas 2006; Fettke and Loos 2007). Referring to Fettke and Loos (2007) and Ardalani et al. (2013), we consider the following features as important:

1. Reusability:  Business  process  reference  models  represent  business  process blueprints for the development of process-oriented IS which can be reused in different IS development projects (vom Brocke 2007).
2. Exemplary practices: Business process reference models can provide common, good or even best practices describing how business processes are actually designed in practice or how they could or should be designed and executed in order to reach certain goals. In this context, a descriptive as well as a prescriptive or even normative connotation of business process reference models becomes apparent depending on their interpretation.
3. Universal applicability: Business process reference models do not only repre-sent business processes of one particular organization but aim at providing universally applicable business process representations which are valuable for different organizations in a certain domain.

Reference models can provide beneﬁts for both theory and practice. Besides the provision of general descriptions of enterprises, which is especially interesting from a theoretical point of view, practice proﬁts, e.g. from decreases in modeling costs,

modeling time and modeling risk as reference models can represent proven solu-tions (Becker and Meise 2011). Moreover, increases in model quality based on the reuse and adaption of already validated process models can be expected.
Prominent examples for reference models which have been extensively used in practice in order to proﬁt from these advantages are, e.g. the Y-CIM Model by Scheer for industrial enterprises (Scheer 1994) or the SAP reference model as a basis for the SAP R/3 system which has been partly published in (Keller and Teufel 1998). An overview of a collection of reference models is provided by the Refer-ence Modeling Catalogue hosted by the Institute for Information Systems (IWi) at the DFKI and Saarland University, Saarbrucken.16 In the following, we present a selection of relevant Business Process Frameworks in the sense of business process reference models: the SCOR Model, ITIL, eTOM and the APQC Process Classiﬁ-cation FrameworkSM (PCF).
¨


3.3.2	Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) Model

The Supply  Chain  Operations  Reference  (SCOR) Model  is a process-oriented reference model for supply chain management which has been introduced in 1996 and further developed by the Supply Chain Council.17 After several revisions, the SCOR model has been availablein version 10since August 2011. Whileat ﬁrst only the 69 founding members were part of the Supply Chain Council, the Council now comprises almost 1,000 companies and research institutions.18
The SCOR model deﬁnes ﬁve different types of processes in organizations. Their relationship is visualized by means of a multi-stage supply chain in Fig. 3:

1. Plan: includes the planning and management of supply and demand for goods. 2. Source: comprises the purchase of goods, the goods receipt, pre-delivery check,
storage and method of payment for any goods.
3. Make: covers all stages of production processing.
4. Deliver: comprises all the steps of the ordering and delivery of goods to the customers.
5. Return: includes all the steps for handling returned goods, both repairs and maintenance are taken into account.

In the study of Fettke (2008) the real world effects of using the SCOR model have been investigated based on different theoretical perspectives, such as the market-based view, the resource-based view and network theory. Moreover, the hypothesis saying that the application of the SCOR model comes with positive effects on typical supply chain management goals is supported by an empirical

study which has addressed all members of the Supply Chain Council. Furthermore, Bolstorff et al. (2007, p. 27) report on additional experiences with the SCOR model:
1. Increase of total income by three per cent after a SCOR project through the reduction of costs and the improvement of customer services;
2. Two to six fold return on capital within 12 months after completion of the SCOR project;
3. Lower operating costs for information technology;
4. One to three per cent increase in annual operating proﬁt.

Besides these ﬁndings, a recent survey identiﬁed positive impacts of using the SCOR model on customer-facing supply chain quality performance and internal-facing business performance (Li et al. 2011). Another survey could also conﬁrm several positive inﬂuences of using the SCOR model on supply chain management performance (Zhou et al. 2011).


3.3.3	Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)

The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) represents a business process framework for IT service management (ITSM) which is widely accepted and applied in professional IT service organizations.19 The current version ITILv3 has been published in 2007 and updated in 2011. ITIL is considered a de-facto standard for ITSM and describes standardized key processes, key concepts and principles, key roles and responsibilities as well as according KPIs and checklists in ﬁve different areas of ITSM. Concerning ITILv3, for each of these areas one separate volume with detailed process descriptions in the following areas has been published: (1) ITIL  Service  Strategy  which supports the deﬁnition of an

Figure 4 visualizes these ﬁve areas of the ITILv3 and the according core processes within these areas.
As ITIL represents the de-facto standard for ITSM, a large amount of experience with the usage of ITIL in practice exists. Furthermore, there is quite an amount of empirical studies conducted by scholars reporting on the positive effects of ITIL usage on IT service organizations’ performance, e.g. Henson and Geray (2010) or Meziani and Saleh (2010) in the context of service management in public admin-istration settings or Lapao et al. (2009) in the context healthcare environments.

Furthermore, there are some recent studies on factors inﬂuencing ITIL adoption, e.g. the contribution of Cater-Steel et al. (2009) or the comprehensive international survey by Marrone and Kolbe (2011) which reports on the ever-increasing ITIL adoption and the increasing realized operational beneﬁts caused by the usage of ITIL.


3.3.4	Enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM)

The enhanced Telecom Operations Map (eTOM) represents a business process reference model for the telecommunications industry which has been introduced by the  TM forum as their  Business Process Framework.20   It provides  a  detailed description of relevant business processes for service providers based on a four-level-hierarchy. Figure 5 shows Level 0 and Level 1 within the eTOM process hierarchy.
Level 0 represents the overall enterprise level and deﬁnes the three major sections: a. Strategy, Infrastructure & Product, b. Operations and c. Enterprise Management. Level 1 “contains seven end-to-end vertical Level 1 process group-ings in the areas of Strategy, Infrastructure and Product and Operations. These vertical  groupings  of  processes  focus  on  end-to-end  activities  [...]  and  each grouping includes processes involving customers, supporting services, resources and suppliers/partners. [...] The horizontal groupings represent major programs or

functions that cut horizontally across an enterprise’s internal business activities.”21 More  detailed  process  deﬁnitions  exist  on  level  2  and  level  3  of  the  eTOM speciﬁcation.
In practice, a certain amount of experience with the application of eTOM exists as it is one of the most popular standards for managing business processes in the telecommunications industry (Tanovic and Androulidakis 2011). However, so far there are only few empirical studies driven by scholars concerning the real world effects of eTOM; e.g. Chou et al. (2008) report on a successful application of eTOM especially in the context of trouble management operations in the largest Taiwan telecommunications  corporation  resulting  in  an  improved  performance  and improved user satisfaction.


3.3.5	APQC Process Classiﬁcation FrameworkSM

The APQC Process Classiﬁcation FrameworkSM (PCF) provides a comprehensive taxonomy of operating processes as well as management and support processes. The PCF supports benchmarking of organizational performance within one or among organizations “regardless of industry, size or location” of the compared organizations by means of a common terminology to describe and compare busi-ness processes.22  It has been developed by the American Productivity & Quality Center (APQC) since the early 1990s and the current version 6 comprises more than 1,000  relevant  business  processes.  Besides  the  cross-industry  version,  several industry-speciﬁc versions of the PCF exist, e.g. for retail, automotive, telecommu-nications, education. The content of the PCF is organized into the following ﬁve levels23:

•   Level 1: Category, represents the highest level of processes in enterprises such as ﬁnancial organization, human resources etc. One example of a category in PCF version 6 is “1.0 Develop Vision and Strategy (10002)”.
•   Level 2: Process Group, represents connected groups of business processes within one category. One example of a process group in PCF version 6 is “1.1 Deﬁne the business concept and long-term vision (10014)”.
•   Level 3: Process, represents a sequence of interrelated activities converting input into output. One example of a process in PCF version 6 is “1.1.1 Assess the external environment (10017)”.
•   Level 4: Activity, comprises key events performed during the execution of a process. One example of an activity in PCF version 6 is “1.1.1.1 Analyze and evaluate competition (10021)”.

Figure 6 gives an overview of the process categories contained in the PCF. According to the APQC reporting, the PCF has been used for business process
management  and  benchmarking  in  many  different  businesses  in  the  last  two decades worldwide and several practical case studies providing detailed experi-ences  with the  PCF  in  renowned companies from  different  industries  exist.24 Furthermore, the PCF has been used as a systemization approach for business processes   as   a   fundament   for   scientiﬁc   empirical   studies   and   surveys, e.g. concerning IT and business process alignment (Cragg et al. 2007; Cragg and Mills 2011) and in the context of comparing service offerings in business transfor-mation projects (Srivastava and Mazzoleni 2010).



4   Discussion

Our investigation showed that the term Business Process Framework is ambiguous and that quite a number of different understandings and usages of this term exist. However,  on  the  basis  of  our  underlying  deﬁnitions  of  business  process  and framework and the commonly identiﬁed understandings an expedient systemization of Business Process Frameworks could be developed.

of each understanding of the term Business Process Framework could further clarify the speciﬁc subtleties of each framework class.
During our investigation, several quite similar Business Process Frameworks within  the  different  classes  have  been  identiﬁed,  e.g.  ARIS  and  CIMOSA as methodical business process engineering approaches, XML-based process model interchange and process integration infrastructures like XPDL and ebBP or ITIL and eTOM as reference models. Figure 7 gives an overview of Business Process Frameworks  within  the  according  classes  which  have  been  presented  in  this contribution.
The similarity of these Business Process Frameworks makes the topic of map-ping frameworks which belong to the same class an interesting subject-matter. In the  above  mentioned  cases  there  are  several  intersections  and  considerable overlapping of addressed content of Business Process Frameworks e.g. comparing ITIL and the COBIT framework, another valuable IT governance framework. In this comparison also several differences in content between such Business Process Frameworks are observable. In practice, this can lead to severe problems when both frameworks could provide important functionality for an organization. In such a context, the mapping of the Business Process Frameworks in terms of terminology, procedure models etc. is highly desirable in order to be able to proﬁt from a combination of functionalities. Such mapping initiatives exist for several Business Process Frameworks, e.g. ITIL and COBIT25  or ITIL and eTOM.26  Furthermore, the mapping of Business Process Frameworks in order to combine functionality and to proﬁt from the strengths of every single approach also seems promising for the other classes of frameworks.

Investigating Business Process Frameworks in the sense of reference models, we found that empirical research concerning the real world effects and relevant char-acteristics like factors inﬂuencing the adoption of a Business Process Framework has so far only been conducted to a moderate extent. In order to assess these empirically observable effects in more detail, more empirical research into this seems to be desirable besides the design of new and innovative Business Process Frameworks.



5   Conclusion

Business Process Frameworks are of considerable importance in Business Process Management  practice  and  research.  In  this  contribution,  we  investigated  the research community’s underlying understanding and usage of the term Business Process Framework which showed to be an ambiguous term with different mean-ings. We introduced a systemization of common understandings and presented several Business Process Frameworks which have been relevant for BPM research and practice in recent years. Thereafter, we discussed our results.
Our assumption that the two central terms business process and framework seem to inﬂuence the Business Process Frameworks term ambiguity seems plausible to a certain extent. In our investigation we found that important aspects and meanings of these underlying terms can be found in the different interpretations of the term Business  Process  Framework  and  in  the  content  dimensions  of  the  presented frameworks.
Future work concerning Business Process Frameworks should – besides the design and further development of innovative frameworks – concentrate on the empirical assessment of the effects of existing Business Process Frameworks in the real world. A further-going investigation of the possibilities of mapping similar Business Process Frameworks could support a better understanding of how valuable functionalities could be combined and, thus, made accessible for practice. How-ever, in this context it has to be further investigated how engineering challenges concerning the maintenance of framework mappings could be facedin order to have consistent and at the same times ﬂexible Business Process Frameworks.

Abstract  The consistent structuring and modeling of behavioral descriptions is a prerequisite to any successful Business Process Management (BPM) initiative. This chapter presents a simple practical framework for aligning various concepts and representations of organizational behavior, which assists identifying appropriate model types. The framework is presented as a means to improve process modeling within BPM initiatives and as a guide to the development and documentation of process architectures. A set of BPMN 2.0 based templates are described which enable the modeling of the concepts in the framework. Both health sector and investment management industry cases studies are described in which the frame-work is used to align descriptions of organizational behavior to produce useful integrated behavioral reference models and uniﬁed process model sets. The frame-work is also used to analyze model and process architecture completeness and structure.


1   Introduction

The ability to readily compare models is fundamental to any BPM initiative concerned with process re-use, improvement, or integration. Business process modeling is often limited in its effectiveness by the inability to produce uniﬁed sets of process models especially where the models have been developed within different organizations or within different contexts. Although there have been approaches to attempt to address this issue (e.g. Becker et al. 2014; Houy et al. 2014),  the  fundamental  problem  is  that  human  behavior  is  expressed  as  a

continuum  and  not  as  discrete  components  of  activity,  consequently  any partitioning or structuring is necessarily ‘imposed’ and to some extent arbitrary. Furthermore, there is a tendency for the term “process” to be applied to behaviors that vary signiﬁcantly in complexity and scope. This lack of speciﬁcity can result in models of the same behavior that bear little resemblance to one another. Clearly, factors other than the behavior or activity itself need to be taken into account  when  attempting  to  determine  appropriate  representation,  and  when aligning these representations across levels of abstraction, organizational bound-aries or project environments.
It is common for a hierarchy of business process models to be developed with a BPM  initiative.  Typically  a  “high  level  conceptual”  model  is  developed  to provide a context and frame of reference for “lower level” more detailed ‘as implemented’ process models (Indulska et al. 2006; Bandara et al. 2005; vom Brocke et al. 2012). The development of process architecture is commonly touted as the means to achieve alignment between such models, although there are few if any  standardized  approaches  (Davis  and  Brabander  2007;  Stephenson  and Brabander 2007). However, without clear agreed deﬁnitions of concepts, levels of abstraction and decomposition, it is difﬁcult to establish whether lower level models within process architecture are aligned with those at higher a level of abstraction. It is commonly assumed that core concepts such as business process, function, or service are deﬁned and commonly agreed within the BPM community at large. However, it can be argued that this is often not evidenced in practice (van der Aalst et al. 2003). Although there are process ‘meta-models’ such as the ARIS business process meta-model (Scheer et al. 2005), and the Business Process Deﬁnition Metamodel (Object Management Group 2008) and while these models may enjoy some popularity in some quarters they are by no means universally agreed and adopted within the global BPM practitioner community. Furthermore neither of these approaches provides a sufﬁcient framework to clearly delineate between the behavioral concepts of service, process, activity, task or related concepts such as capability and function, and the relationships between them. For  example,  within  the  ARIS  business  process  meta-model  all  behavior  is represented by the concept ‘function’. While it is possible to have sub-functions the meta-model does not speciﬁcally differentiate as different classes of activity, an end-to-end service provided to a customer, and a single constituent activity or task within a single business unit.
¨
¨
A common problem is that of establishing an appropriate level of abstraction or decomposition  for  any  description  of  organizational  behavior.  Although  two models may have been developed to describe the same process, they may be different in scope and the level of detail they include. Combining or comparing such models often means that one of the models has to be revised in order to establish whether the scope of the individual models is compatible, and whether the same behavior is being represented. The notions of abstraction, generalization, and aggregation were identiﬁed from within the data base and data modeling perspective  by  John  and  Diane  Smith  in  their  landmark  article  ‘Database
A Framework for Classifying and Modeling Organizational Behavior	179

Abstractions: Aggregation and Generalization” (1977). The authors were amongst the ﬁrst to identify the dimensions of abstraction by aggregation (i.e., composed of), and abstraction by generalization (i.e., type of). The issue of abstraction as it applies to process modeling has been dealt with extensively from an academic perspective (Polyvyanyy et al. 2014). The approach described by Polyvyanyy et al. (2014) obviously has merit as a means to reduce potentially irrelevant or extraneous details from within a complex process model. However, the concept of abstraction is to a degree arbitrary in that the target audience and viewpoint ‘owner’ (i.e., Becker et al. 2003) at least in part drive the determination of what constitutes ‘signiﬁcant detail’. Furthermore, measures such as ‘frequency of use’ and ‘execution effort’ are not necessarily measures of process or task criticality. What is required is a simple set of practical, readily applied rules to allow the practitioner to structure and develop uniﬁed models of comparable abstraction or decomposition.
Although organizational behavior can be viewed at the macro level of the services provided, it can equally be viewed from the perspective of constituent tasks and single executable steps within these. Moreover, organizational behavior can be understood in terms of the behaviors of groups of individual actors (i.e., organizational units), as well as at the level of the individual. This multifaceted and ﬂuid nature of organizational behavior means that there are few absolute points of reference upon which to structure and compare behavioral models. Indeed, it can be argued that useful abstraction cannot be directly derived from analysis of the process  model  structure  alone  (Smirnov  2011)  and  that  the  wider  contextual meaning of the model needs to be a consideration.
This problem is further compounded where process models include elements from differing levels of abstraction within the one model. Typical examples of this occur where for reasons of modeling expediency, implementation level details are mixed with logical or conceptual level descriptions. This limits the capacity for model re-use, and will inevitably mean that the model will need to be revised when there are changes made at the level of physical implementation.
The aim of this chapter is to present a framework that has been developed, reﬁned and extended over several years, that provides a simple set of rules to guide practitioners in the structuring, partitioning and development of uniﬁed sets of process models. The framework contains a set of criteria that can be readily and applied to representations (i.e. models) of behavior or activity to more reliably identify  the  level  of  abstraction  being  used,  the  behavioral  concept  being represented, and to promote the development of uniﬁed process and behavioral models across modeling initiatives. The framework presented in this chapter has been applied in both the health and ﬁnancial investment industries. The framework is essentially a meta-model of behavioral concepts. The framework includes some modeling constraints and rules which are particularly suited to the use of Business Process  Modeling  Notation  (BPMN)  and  its  use  of  the  constructs  ‘Collapsed Sub-process’ and ‘Swimlanes’. The following section describes the circumstances that gave rise to the framework, and the process of its development.

2   Framework Development

2.1	Background and Genesis

The need for a framework arose from a requirement to develop both function and service reference models within a large health sector agency in which an ehealth initiative was to be implemented. The ehealth initiative involved providing health services using information  systems  and technologies which  enabled  improved communication and collaboration between clinicians, as well as greater participa-tion by patients in their own care. The reference models were required to allow consistent  mapping  of  current  and  future  state  business  processes  and  their supporting applications and technologies to better understand the scope of required changes. In the absence of any recognized industry reference models, the models had to be derived by combining a number of existing models and standards. Some of these models were speciﬁc to the health industry while others were more general descriptions of organizational behavior. The contributing models and their respec-tive  scopes  are  listed  in  Table  1  and  are  brieﬂy  described  in  the  following paragraphs.
The American  Society  for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has published a number of technical standards for the health care industry. Of particular interest to our modeling efforts was the Standard Speciﬁcation for a Healthcare Conceptual Process Model (ASTM WK50681). This was described as a conceptual level model. The model is structured using the IDEF0 format (ANSI Publications 1320.1 1998) and describes four levels of process decomposition, although not all levels are speciﬁed for all processes within the model.
The Health Level Seven (HL7) Electronic Health Records (EHR) System Model (ANSI 2007) was also described as a conceptual level view of health functions. However, the EHR system model departs from the ASTM model by focusing on those functions necessary to support an EHR system. While the scope focuses on application  functionality,  the  model  was  developed  to  be  independent  of  any technology solution or implementation strategy. The model had four levels of decomposition; however, not all levels are speciﬁed for all functions speciﬁed in the model.
The Australian Council on Health Standards (ACHS) is an organization respon-sible for assessing, accrediting, and reviewing the performance of Australian health organizations in respect to their quality and safety. The Evaluation and Quality Improvement Program (EQuIP) was developed to support the ACHS. The EQuIP requirements were used by the authors to identify a number of key process patterns. These patterns were then compiled into an overarching process model for health care treatment (Stephenson 2005).

The American Productivity and Quality Commission (APQC) has developed a comprehensive taxonomy of generic processes applicable in many industries. The APCQ model was the most comprehensive of the models referenced, with more than 1,000 processes and activities included. It provided a useful framework to describe and understand the nonclinical operations within the health agency. This model contains four levels of decomposition and is broadly structured according to the Porter Value Chain model (Porter 1996).
On inspection, it was apparent that the level of description and abstraction varied markedly across the selected models. In order to successfully combine the various process and function descriptions contained within the models, it was necessary to develop a core set of deﬁnitions and relationships between these (i.e. a meta-model).



2.2	A Framework for Behavior Classiﬁcation and Modeling

This section describes a framework developed to categorize descriptions of orga-nizational behavior. Figure 1 illustrates the core concepts within the framework and highlights the two distinct perspectives (i.e. functional and service oriented) for a single set of common processes. The Service perspective describes how the orga-nization operates, the Functional perspective describes how the organization or the activities in the organization are structured and controlled.
The framework is based on the not uncommon proposition that services can be deﬁned as sequences of processes that are in turn located within functions or capabilities  within  an  organization.  The  functional  view  provides  a  means  to logically group and control processes within an organization, whereas a services oriented view describes the way in which processes are actually used. The wavy colored arrow lines in Fig. 1 could be considered to represent “compositions” or “arrangements”  of  processes  which  implement a  given  service.  Figure  1  also highlights that some processes may be used by many services, whereas a process typically only appears within a single function. The same process appearing in more than one function is an indication of possible inefﬁciency.
In order to develop a framework that would deﬁne these concepts, their relation-ships,  and to provide a way  to abstract (i.e.,  aggregate and generalize)  them

consistently the following reference models were considered; Process Architecture Framework (Davis 2006),  Supply-Chain  Operations Reference-model  (Supply-Chain Council 2008) (SCOR), Business Process Deﬁnition MetaModel Object Management Group (OMG) (2008), APQC – Process Classiﬁcation Framework, the ARIS business process meta-model (Scheer et al. 2005), and the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) Enterprise Language (ISO/IEC 15414:2002). Each of these frameworks and their contribution is brieﬂy discussed in the following paragraphs.
The Process Architecture Framework (Davis 2006) consists of a descending hierarchy organizational behavior types; Business Activities, Process Groupings, Core Processes, Business Process Flows, Operational Process Flows, and Detailed Process Flows. The level of detail increases down the hierarchy. The patterns identiﬁed at each level represent the process architecture of the organization. This framework has been used extensively within British Telecom. However, the con-cept of ‘process’ seems overloaded in this framework. Furthermore framework does not appear to readily support the concept of a service that iscomposed of a sequence of processes. Nonetheless, the Process Architecture Framework (Davis 2006) does provide a means to identify varying levels of process abstraction (i.e., aggregation). The Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model SCOR (Supply-Chain Council 2008) is an industry reference model for the management and planning of supply chains. SCOR includes deﬁnitions of performance metrics, processes, practices and skills and training required for the effective management of supply chains. SCOR

deﬁnes the following four levels of processes. Level 1 Processes – describe the scope and high level conﬁguration of a supply chain (i.e., the main phases). Level 2 Processes – represent the supply chain strategy or implementation. Level 3 Pro-cesses – describe the steps to execute the Level 2 Processes, Level 4 Processes describe industry speciﬁc activities required to perform Level 3 Processes and are not formally part of SCOR. Although SCOR does promote a hierarchical structur-ing of organizational behavior it does not readily support the concepts necessary for a functional or capability view of processes within the hierarchy. However, SCOR does reinforce the notion of end-to-end process composition, and provides a means for decomposing these compositions into more detailed descriptions.
The Business Process Deﬁnition MetaModel (Object Management Group 2008) provides a UML based “framework for understanding and specifying the processes of  an  organization  or  community”,  and  provides  a  meta-model  and  precisely deﬁned semantics for BPMN concepts and process modeling in general. An impor-tant concept is that of Performer Role that has responsibility for the execution of a Process. Swimlanes in BPMN represent this concept.
Itis the concept of Swmlanes that provides a mechanism to deﬁne the boundaries of a Process, and compartmentalize business activity according to the entity con-trolling  the activity (i.e. the Performer Role). The swimlane is also likely to represent the ‘viewpoint’ of the entity fulﬁlling the Performer Role. The entity may be an organization, a business unit within the organization, or individual employees or systems. These entities can be represented abstractly as ‘enterprise’, ‘functional area’ or ‘function’, and ‘actor’.
The American Productivity and Quality Commission (APQC) Process Classiﬁ-cation Framework (PCF) has been described in the previous section. It provides a process reference model for a generic enterprise in much the same way that SCOR does for supply chains. The PCF consists of four levels of process decomposition across all functional capabilities.2
The  ARIS  business  process  meta-model  and  the  ‘ARIS  House’  were  also considered in the formulation of the framework. Although the ARIS meta-model is popular framework and complies with the OMG MOF formalism, all behavioral concepts are encompassed in the single concept of Function. Consequently, the meta-model provides limited capacity to differentiate between behavioral concepts in our framework such as Service, Process and Task (i.e., they are all types of ARIS Functions or sub-Functions).
The Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) Enterprise Language (ISO/IEC 15414:2002) and the ISO/IEC 19793: Information technology – Open  distributed  processing  –  Use  of  Uniﬁed  Modeling  Language  (UML)  for ODP system speciﬁcations (2004) both contain a series of deﬁnitions of behavioral



2 Since the time of writing the APQC PCF has improved the formalism of the four levels in the latest revision describing them as; Process Category, Process Group, Process, and Activity. This has also improved alignment between the APQC deﬁnitions and the concepts of Functional Domain and Function in the framework presented in this chapter.

Table 2  Core concepts and levels of abstraction
Core concept
Environment: the context in which an enterprise operates, which includes external parties, their relationships to the enterprise, and the requirements of these relationships Community: a group of enterprise objects which exhibit behaviors and fulﬁll roles to achieve a common purpose or aim Enterprise: a type of community, as are the organizational units of which it is comprised, as to the other organizations the enterprise interacts with
Service: a sequence of processes initiated and terminated by a client role, delivered via an interface role, and controlled or constrained by a contract
Functional domain: the highest level at which Functions are grouped within an Enterprise. Usually corresponds to an implemented Division within the organization at the physical level of abstraction
Function: an enterprise capability represented by a normalized grouping of processes which share a common objective, aim, or goal
Process composition: a sequence of processes which may implement all or part of a service and be undertaken by actors within one or more functions within a functional domain Process: a sequence of tasks undertaken by actors within a single community
Task: a sequence of steps undertaken by an individual actor that results in the change in state of the object being acted upon Step: activity which results in a change to an attribute of an object
Organizational unit: a group of human resources, systems and business resources that implements one or more functions is responsible to execute one or more processes
Actor: a business resource (human or system) that performs a task

In developing the framework it was clear that some concepts described different levels  of  generalization  (e.g.,  capability  vs.  resource)  while  others  addressed abstraction via aggregation (e.g., business function vs. organizational unit). This analysis resulted in the following table (Table 2) of core concepts and levels of abstraction.
The  four  levels  of  abstraction  and  their  deﬁnitions  are  described  in  detail elsewhere (Aitken 2008; Stephenson and Bandara 2007). The framework presented in this chapter is an application of the Aitken (2008) general modeling framework

These concepts form a hierarchy of behavioral decomposition in which subor-dinate concepts elaborate a parent concept. Importantly, Fig. 2 also illustrates the two alternative views of organizational behavior supported by the framework. The service  oriented  view  is  concerned  with  sequencing  of  behavior  whereas  the function oriented view provides a means for behavioral classiﬁcation.
Although the levels of abstraction within the framework bear a superﬁcial resemblance to those within other frameworks (e.g., The Zachman Framework, Zachman 2005), the terms “contextual,” “conceptual,” “logical,” and “physical” have speciﬁc meanings that have been detailed elsewhere (Aitken 2008). The application of these levels to the behavioral concepts within the framework is now discussed.
The contextual level represents the highest level of abstraction both in terms of generalization and aggregation within the framework. The concepts relevant to this level are the communities within the external environment of the enterprise or organization.  The  internal  behavior  of  the  organization  is  not  described  or represented by models at this level. However, the environment, external parties and customers, their relationships to the enterprise in question, and the require-ments of these relationships are all legitimate behavioral components that might be represented within a contextual level behavioral model.
The criteria for models at the contextual level are that they treat the enterprise of concern as a “black box,” they model the roles and relationships between the enterprise and other entities in its environment, describe the requirements of these relationships, and identify the outcomes that are the result of enterprise activity. The IDEF0 Level 0 model might be used to represent some of these components, although other models such as the RM ODP Enterprise Speciﬁcation model might equally be suitable candidates (see ITU-T Rec. X.906|ISO/IEC 19793: Information technology – Open distributed processing – Use of UML for ODP system speciﬁ-cations 2004). Such models are used within the framework to provide a frame of reference for, and identify the overall requirements that must be satisﬁed by the process compositions, and processes described in subsequent levels.
The second level of abstraction within the framework is the conceptual level. This level is concerned with describing the internal behavioral constructs of the enterprise that are typically true of both current and future states. The behavioral constructs at this level within the framework are represented by the concepts “service” and “functional domain.” These terms are considered conceptual level concepts in that they do not provide a description of the internal workings of the organization, but they do capture its deﬁning behavioral characteristics and struc-ture. Both constructs can be considered concepts that describe “what” is done or needed  to  be  achieved  without  specifying  “how”  this  is  done.  Descriptions concerning “how” things are done (i.e., design) are covered at the logical level. In this sense, both the functional and service views provide two separate perspec-tives on the same set of internal processes within an organization. The criteria for behavioral models at this level are as follows:
